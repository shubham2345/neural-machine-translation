H-0	-0.6012558341026306	Today everybody &apos;s talking about happiness .
H-1	-0.8276433348655701	There &apos;s somebody who wanted to count the number of books published over the last five years , whose title of happiness . &quot; He gave the end of the 40th , there was much more .
H-2	-1.042145013809204	The theme of happiness becomes to the fashion of the researchers .
H-3	-1.1970893144607544	There &apos;s a lot of happiness techniques .
H-4	-0.6749241352081299	Everybody wants to make other more happy .
H-5	-1.4239475727081299	But despite the uncalculable number of work , it &apos;s getting cognitive pities that prevent to have a correct view of happiness .
H-6	-1.4445035457611084	My talk today &apos;s going to be mainly on these very cognitive pies .
H-7	-1.1265002489089966	It &apos;s going to be interested in the November that think about their own happiness , but also the people who think about happiness , because , in the end , we &apos;re all as palm as others .
H-8	-1.4031703472137451	The first guy is the rejet of complexity .
H-9	-0.616381049156189	It &apos;s from the fact that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just a useful word , because we use it for too much things .
H-10	-0.9409266114234924	And after me , we could make it to a particular meaning , but eventually it &apos;s a path to give and we &apos;re going to have to adopt the notion more complex what it &apos;s good .
H-11	-0.7066277861595154	The second cognitive discognitive is the confusion between the lived and memory : it &apos;s just the difference between being happy in his life and be happy of his life , or with his life .
H-12	-0.6200975775718689	And these two concepts are very different , and they &apos;re mixed in the notion of the bohnor .
H-13	-1.1243138313293457	The third &#91; unclear &#93; is &#91; unclear &#93; &quot; and that &apos;s this miserable phenomenon that makes that you can &apos;t think of any event as our well @-@ being @-@ being @-@ being .
H-14	-0.9719117879867554	I mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
H-15	-0.558582067489624	It &apos;s impossible to perceive it properly .
H-16	-0.7633829116821289	I &apos;m going to take the example of a person who &apos;s done after one of my talks .
H-17	-0.9800188541412354	He told that he had listened to a symphony and it was fabulous and everything at the end of reading , there was a horrible sound .
H-18	-1.1823525428771973	And he &apos;s added , quite moved , that it had killed all the experience .
H-19	-0.6953982710838318	But no !
H-20	-0.80862957239151	They &apos;re the memories of the experience that had been killed .
H-21	-0.7765437960624695	He lived this experiment .
H-22	-0.49629390239715576	He had 20 minutes of fantastic music .
H-23	-1.0392076969146729	They didn &apos;t have any value , because what was going to be , it was a memory ; the memory was , and that remember , it &apos;s all that was left .
H-24	-0.8661028742790222	It teaches us , in the bottom , that we can &apos;t perceive us and others in two very distinct entities .
H-25	-0.878352701663971	There &apos;s a me that &apos;s all about the moment , that &apos;s living in the present and knows the present , it &apos;s able to live the past , but , basically , all that he has , is the present .
H-26	-1.0292699337005615	It &apos;s that being that we &apos;ve been doing that the doctor approach -- you know , when the doctor requires , &quot; It &apos;s wrong if I &apos;m going to touch you ? &quot;
H-27	-0.8859750628471375	And then , there &apos;s the me who remember , and that &apos;s the one that &apos;s holding the accounts , and it &apos;s how the doctor is approach and who &apos;s asking : How do you feel these last days ? &quot;
H-28	-0.8993790745735168	or &quot; How &apos;s happened your day in Albania ? &quot; or things like this .
H-29	-1.3006672859191895	These two entities are very different , the self of the experience and I &apos;m the self @-@ to @-@ the @-@ day , and I &apos;m the self @-@ to @-@ the @-@ problem sources .
H-30	-1.1165598630905151	The self of the remember is a stories of stories .
H-31	-0.9934172630310059	And it &apos;s really starting by a elementary reflex of our memory -- it &apos;s immediately immediately .
H-32	-0.6002392172813416	We don &apos;t just tell stories , when you start telling a story .
H-33	-0.6646499037742615	It &apos;s our memory that tells us stories , in fact , what we &apos;re holding in our lived is a story .
H-34	-0.5446738600730896	And let me start with a example .
H-35	-0.5616430044174194	It &apos;s from a old study .
H-36	-1.6634196043014526	The real patients are getting a painful surgery .
H-37	-0.5312979221343994	I &apos;m not going to go into the details . It &apos;s not painful of our days , but it was at the time of this study , in the &apos; 90s .
H-38	-0.6733874678611755	We asked them to describe their pain all the 60 seconds .
H-39	-0.7038507461547852	Here &apos;s the recording .
H-40	-1.1685326099395752	from two patients .
H-41	-0.6665582656860352	The question is , &quot; What has suffered the most ? &quot;
H-42	-0.3167690336704254	It &apos;s a very simple question .
H-43	-0.7407881021499634	It &apos;s clear that the B B has more suffered .
H-44	-1.1793659925460815	His colonscopy was much longer , and for every minute of suffering for the patient &apos;s patient , B was also , but even more .
H-45	-0.5859423279762268	But here &apos;s a second question : &quot; How do these patients think they have suffered ? &quot;
H-46	-0.9651756286621094	And here &apos;s a surprise : It &apos;s that the patient &apos;s got a much worse memory of the colonics that the B B .
H-47	-1.090463399887085	And the course of the colonies was different , a very important point of these stories is how they end up -- and none of these experiments was pleasant or motivated -- but one of them can distinguish ...
H-48	-0.6840122938156128	but one of them is distinct worse than the other .
H-49	-1.0753663778305054	And the worst one is where pain gets a peak at the end .
H-50	-0.7698580622673035	It &apos;s a story .
H-51	-0.35129016637802124	How do we know that ?
H-52	-1.0785534381866455	Tell us that we asked these people , just after their colonia , and also long after , &quot; Finally , what is it a hard thing ? &quot;
H-53	-1.5175336599349976	And I had the worst @-@ term goods that B .
H-54	-0.8294690251350403	In fact , it &apos;s a live conflict between the self of the experience and me &apos;s me .
H-55	-1.1175965070724487	From the view of the experience , &quot; clearly , B has spent a more bad time .
H-56	-1.245370626449585	Now , what we could have been able to do with the patient A , and , in fact , we &apos;ve done medical tests , it &apos;s been done and it &apos;s been done and it &apos;s been able and it &apos;s been able , we could have been able to have the duration of the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s going to have the tube in the inside , without too much the side .
H-57	-1.0916107892990112	It &apos;s so to make the patient , but just a little bit , and much less than before .
H-58	-1.1171830892562866	By doing that for a few minutes , you &apos;re going to take a agacation for the lived &quot; me &apos;s &quot; I &apos;ve lived in the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient .
H-59	-0.7141083478927612	What does a story ?
H-60	-0.6818601489067078	And that &apos;s true stories that we &apos;re provided by our memory , like stories that we do .
H-61	-0.8043153882026672	What &apos;s a story , it &apos;s the changes , the important moments and the end .
H-62	-0.8670713901519775	The final way is very , very significant and , in this example , the end determines everything .
H-63	-1.004294991493225	So , &quot; I &apos;m like the experience &quot; lives his life in the continuity .
H-64	-1.1003466844558716	It &apos;s aucting experiments , one after others .
H-65	-0.649101972579956	And if you ask what happens to these moments ,
H-66	-1.3179047107696533	The answer is pretty direct .
H-67	-0.6218746304512024	They &apos;re lost to ever .
H-68	-0.7278640866279602	What I mean is that most of the moments of our life -- and I &apos;ve been evaluated -- the psychological present is about three seconds .
H-69	-0.8524656891822815	What means , in fact , there &apos;s about 600 million of a life .
H-70	-0.6898074746131897	In a month , it &apos;s about 600 .
H-71	-0.9540033340454102	Most of them don &apos;t leave anything .
H-72	-0.9557957053184509	Most of them are completely ignored by our &quot; me &apos;s . &quot;
H-73	-0.8381109237670898	But however , sometimes you &apos;re aware that they should count , that what &apos;s going on for these moments where we live a experience , it &apos;s our life .
H-74	-0.6167393922805786	It &apos;s the limited resource that we use in our life on Earth .
H-75	-1.0010813474655151	And the way of using it , really appropriate , but it &apos;s not this story that our &quot; I &apos;m going to do .
H-76	-0.8378351330757141	In the end , we &apos;ve got our &quot; I &apos;ve got &quot; me &quot; and our experience , &quot; and they &apos;re really quite different .
H-77	-0.635615885257721	The biggest difference between them is the perception of time .
H-78	-0.8108325004577637	From the view of your experience , &quot; if you &apos;re in vacation , and the second week happens as well as the first week , then these two weeks of vacation will be two times better than one week .
H-79	-0.9342060685157776	It &apos;s not all like that &apos;s going on for our &quot; I &apos;m like . &quot;
H-80	-0.9868709444999695	For him , two weeks , it &apos;s going to be better than a single week because no memory is added .
H-81	-0.5356395840644836	You don &apos;t changed the story .
H-82	-1.169263482093811	It &apos;s the time of this angle , the time is actually the capital variable that distinguishes our &quot; me &apos;s &quot; me &apos;s me . &quot;
H-83	-0.8192685842514038	The time is that little impact on this story .
H-84	-0.9686607122421265	And I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m much more than memorizing and tell stories .
H-85	-0.9937794804573059	In fact , it &apos;s what takes decisions because you &apos;ve got a patient who &apos;s suffered , let &apos;s say , two colones with two different surgeons , which has to decide which to choose , and the one that the memories is the least bad , it &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s going to be chosen .
H-86	-0.9064160585403442	&quot; I &apos;m like the experience &quot; didn &apos;t have his word to say in this choice .
H-87	-0.5558279752731323	In fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiments ,
H-88	-0.8938522338867188	We choose between memories of these experiments .
H-89	-0.5545548796653748	And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think about it in terms of experiments .
H-90	-0.7949544787406921	We think about our future in anticipating memories .
H-91	-1.2864488363265991	We can just represent this just like a tyranm of &quot; I &apos;ll remember &quot; I &apos;m like &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m not asking .
H-92	-0.9850795269012451	I feel that when you &apos;re in vacation is very common , it &apos;s to say that we &apos;re in vacation , in some way , in the orders of our memory . &quot;
H-93	-0.48277872800827026	And , I think , it &apos;s pretty hard to justify .
H-94	-1.0962228775024414	Well , what do we feed us from our memories ?
H-95	-0.9915591478347778	It &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s advanced for the domination of our self . &quot;
H-96	-1.1776150465011597	And it &apos;s been thinking about vacation that we &apos;ve been in Antarctica , a few years ago , who &apos;s been the best vacation that I &apos;ve ever got , and I &apos;ve been thinking pretty often , compared to the number of times I think about .
H-97	-0.9581552147865295	to my other vacation . I probably consumed my memories of this three @-@ week @-@ week , while , I would say , about 25 minutes for four years .
H-98	-1.1435540914535522	After , if I opened a time the album that contains 600 photos , I would have a extra hour .
H-99	-1.3907147645950317	It &apos;s been for three weeks and the end of this is that one hour and a half of it .
H-100	-1.7806462049484253	It &apos;s going to be proported .
H-101	-0.8986903429031372	It &apos;s possible that I don &apos;t be representative of the average , what I &apos;ve got little taste for the consumption of my memories , but even if you &apos;ve got more than me , a fundamental question is :
H-102	-1.0223246812820435	Why do we give us much weight to our memories , comparison from the one that we &apos;re giving our experiments ?
H-103	-0.5569919943809509	I &apos;d like you to think about a brain experience .
H-104	-1.485451579093933	Imagine that to your next vacation , that at the end of these vacation , all your photos are destroyed , and that you &apos;re going to be a crp that makes amneian that you can &apos;t remember anything .
H-105	-1.0631322860717773	So , let &apos;s take you the same type of vacation ?
H-106	-0.5327771902084351	And if you did another choice , there &apos;s a conflict between your two entities , and you &apos;ve got to think how to arbitrary this conflict , and it &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think in terms of time , you &apos;ll have a answer .
H-107	-0.5223399996757507	And if you think about memories , you might have another answer .
H-108	-1.0647525787353516	Why are we going to go on the vacation , that &apos;s a problem that we put to a choice between the two &quot; me . &quot;
H-109	-0.8454679250717163	The two &quot; me &quot; we &apos;re going to see two notions of happiness .
H-110	-1.0101789236068726	There &apos;s really two designs of happiness that apply to each other .
H-111	-1.2194149494171143	So we ask : How do I get the experience &quot; is it happy ?
H-112	-1.1921603679656982	What point are happy these moments in life &apos;s life ? &quot;
H-113	-0.7121697664260864	They &apos;re all ; the happiness of the moment is a pretty complex process .
H-114	-0.6753193736076355	What are the emotions that we can quantify ?
H-115	-0.8475232720375061	Now , now we have a more clear idea of what &apos;s happiness &apos;s happiness &apos;s &quot; me &apos;s &quot; in the time .
H-116	-0.7415246963500977	If you think about happiness &apos;s happiness , &quot; it &apos;s a whole other story .
H-117	-0.7946115136146545	It &apos;s nothing to do with the fact of having a happy life .
H-118	-0.6976680159568787	But how we &apos;re satisfied , or happy , thinking about our life .
H-119	-0.9776809215545654	It &apos;s very different .
H-120	-1.0461748838424683	What doesn &apos;t find these two notions is about the point of the study of happiness , and I &apos;m in the crowd of the well @-@ being , who failed the study of happiness for a long time , precisely in that way .
H-121	-0.9703214764595032	The distinction between the happiness of our &quot; me of the experience &quot; and the satisfaction of our , &quot; I &apos;ve been comtaken that very recently , and there are now projects so to measure the two separate separate . The Gallup organization has made a polp with 500,000 people to ask them what they thought of their lives and their experiences .
H-122	-0.7190332412719727	And there &apos;s some other things in this sense .
H-123	-0.673323392868042	Over the last few years , we started learning things about happiness &apos;s happiness . &quot;
H-124	-0.4591037333011627	According to me , the main lesson that we &apos;ve learned is that these two entities are very different .
H-125	-1.1793879270553589	You can see that a person &apos;s been satisled to his life , but it doesn &apos;t learn a lot about the degree of happiness with which it lives , and inverted .
H-126	-0.4818665385246277	Just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about five .
H-127	-0.8373191952705383	It &apos;s as if you &apos;re looking at somebody who tells you that his father makes two feet . What can you say about the size of this person ?
H-128	-0.5649548768997192	Well , you &apos;ve got an indication , but there &apos;s a big degree of uncertainty .
H-129	-0.6806799173355103	You &apos;ve got a lot of uncertainty .
H-130	-1.13857901096344	If I told you that a person at noted his life eight on 10 , you &apos;re not going to be wrong to estimate the level of happiness &apos;s happiness &apos;s level . &quot;
H-131	-1.0104639530181885	If the correlation is low .
H-132	-0.828881561756134	We know a little bit what controls happiness &apos;s satisfaction .
H-133	-0.6937100291252136	We know that money has a important place , the goals also .
H-134	-0.870290219783783	We know that happiness is mostly people that we enjoy , the time we &apos;re going on with them .
H-135	-0.7035609483718872	There &apos;s other pleasures , but this point .
H-136	-0.6228715181350708	So if you want to maximize the happiness of both &quot; me , &quot; you &apos;re going to end up to do very different things .
H-137	-1.0144816637039185	The point of my talk is that we shouldn &apos;t really think about happiness as much as well @-@ being .
H-138	-0.7040819525718689	It &apos;s two very different things .
H-139	-1.087929368019104	To do short , another reason that we &apos;re going to have the clear ideas on happiness , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t worry about the same things when you think about life or when we live it .
H-140	-0.7764532566070557	If you ask the simple question of knowing how much of the California &apos;s people are happy , you &apos;re not going to be a correct answer .
H-141	-0.6033838391304016	When you ask that question , you think people have to be happier in California , that , say , in the Ohio .
H-142	-0.5251433253288269	And what there is is that when you think about life in California , you think about the contrast between California and other places , and the contrast , say , is in climate .
H-143	-0.9528715014457703	Well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the me &quot; I &apos;m not more than for me , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; and that decides if people are happy .
H-144	-1.2056777477264404	But , good , because it &apos;s the &quot; me that &apos;s going to say , &quot; which &apos;s going to be , you &apos;re going to make it -- finally , to move up for California .
H-145	-0.8973758816719055	It &apos;s interesting , to follow those who &apos;s moving for California , in the hope of being happier .
H-146	-0.8211051225662231	In fact , their experience &quot; I &apos;m not going to be happier .
H-147	-0.9327501058578491	We &apos;re all aware of it .
H-148	-0.7357337474822998	But it will happen something : They &apos;ll be convinced to be happier . Because when they &apos;re going to be , they &apos;re going to rememorize the bad time in Ohio .
H-149	-0.7183383703231812	And they &apos;re going to get the right decision .
H-150	-0.9157950282096863	It &apos;s very difficult to actually evaluate her well . I hope you &apos;ve shown how hard it &apos;s hard .
H-151	-0.411713182926178	Thank you .
H-152	-0.322467178106308	Thank you . I have a question to ask you .
H-153	-0.22337691485881805	Thank you very much .
H-154	-0.6834415197372437	A few weeks ago , we &apos;ve talked about the phone , you told me that the Gallup Gallup had provided quite interesting results .
H-155	-0.7359957098960876	Can you tell us more now that you &apos;ve got a little bit of time ?
H-156	-0.8810725212097168	Of course .
H-157	-1.1225658655166626	And after me , the most significant result of this survey is a number , that we didn &apos;t care to find .
H-158	-0.8840528726577759	We found that about happiness &apos; me &apos;s me . &quot;
H-159	-1.6348052024841309	When we &apos;re looking at how the dominant happiness on the income function .
H-160	-0.8116245269775391	And it &apos;s happened that below 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans , and it was a very important sample , around 600 ,000 , it &apos;s a very representative sample , below 2,000 dollars a year --
H-161	-1.9603145122528076	And you &apos;re just .
H-162	-1.9603145122528076	And you &apos;re just .
H-163	-0.66519695520401	60 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and less they make more they &apos;re unhappy .
H-164	-1.0171074867248535	On the top , the line of happiness is absolutely flat .
H-165	-1.1735005378723145	So , I &apos;ve never seen a also flat line .
H-166	-1.0188769102096558	We clearly see that money doesn &apos;t buy happy experiments , but it &apos;s not going to give you the misery , and you can quantify that misery of a very precise .
H-167	-0.8945061564445496	For the other entity , the &quot; I &apos;ll remember , &quot; it &apos;s a whole other story .
H-168	-0.9942132234573364	The more you get money , the more you &apos;re satisfied .
H-169	-0.3451158404350281	It doesn &apos;t work for emotions .
H-170	-1.0966770648956299	Danny , the leital leitv of the U.S. is entirely based on life , freedom and search for happiness .
H-171	-0.9643779397010803	If you &apos;re giving credit to these research , they &apos;ve got the air to go to against everything that we believe , for example , taxes and so on .
H-172	-1.3047035932540894	Is there any chance that the leaders , that the country , in his together , take a kind of discovery in serious and put on the political policies on it ?
H-173	-0.7717015147209167	I think the role of the research of happiness are recognized in public policy .
H-174	-0.7133203744888306	This recognition is the way in the United States , it &apos;s certain , but in England , it &apos;s happening , and also in other countries .
H-175	-0.8405823707580566	People recognize that they &apos;re forced to take happiness when they &apos;re doing public policy .
H-176	-1.0827784538269043	It &apos;s going to take time , we &apos;re going to do , if you &apos;re going to do experiments to study happiness , or if we want studies of life &apos;s assessment . We need to begin to start this debate quickly . How we &apos;re going to do happiness can go through different ways to think , and if you think about &quot; I &apos;re thinking about the experience . &quot;
H-177	-0.5825476050376892	It &apos;s going to influence the political decisions , I think , in the years that come .
H-178	-1.2675262689590454	In the United States , the efforts are set to measure happiness &apos;s happiness .
H-179	-0.7991877198219299	It &apos;s going to be , for me , in 10 or 20 years , in national statistics .
H-180	-0.6676639914512634	Well , it turns out that this problem will be , or at least should be , the most interesting political debate to follow in the next few years .
H-181	-0.3027039170265198	Thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
H-182	-0.49021732807159424	Thank you Daniel Kahneman . I &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago I was writing a article for Wired Italy .
H-183	-0.842345118522644	I &apos;ve always got my dictionary in my hand in the hand when I write , but I &apos;d already finished the article and I realized I had never , in my life , looked at the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what I would find .
H-184	-0.8424164056777954	Let me read you the entrance .
H-185	-2.660163164138794	&quot; Handied , &quot; adjective , &quot; infirm , imtious , useless , accidental , broken , mutilated , wounded , initous , boitous , esited , unblred , unstrong , unpowerful , unpowerful , distired , paralyzed , disgred , shred , blah , clapped , unapped , unrured , broken and weak .
H-186	-1.059130311012268	It &apos;s a good health , strong , capable . &quot;
H-187	-0.9864694476127625	I was reading this high @-@ voice list to a friend and at the beginning I was laughing , it was so cave , but I just went , I just spent mutilated , and my voice was broken , and I had to stop me for me to help me from the emotional shock and the impact that the aggressive of these words would get .
H-188	-0.5316042304039001	You know , of course , it &apos;s my old dictionary in lottery .
H-189	-0.9682157039642334	I &apos;m saying , it &apos;s got to be a old date of feeling , right .
H-190	-0.7610951662063599	But in fact , the date was at the early &apos; 80s , at the moment I had to start primary school and form a understanding of me outside the family cell and report with the other kids and the world around me .
H-191	-0.8694657683372498	And it &apos;s not going to say that God , I didn &apos;t use that dictionary at the time .
H-192	-1.0860487222671509	I mean , in this entrance , it turns out that I was born in a world that would perceive people like me as not having nothing for them , then , in fact , today , I &apos;m being celebrated for opportunities and adventures that my life got me .
H-193	-1.3957470655441284	So I &apos;m all to go to the 2009 in 2009 , and I &apos;m waiting to find a notable revision .
H-194	-0.912732720375061	Here &apos;s the news version of this entrance .
H-195	-0.41375336050987244	Unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
H-196	-0.653430163860321	I find the last two words under &quot; Antonymy close , &quot; particularly disturbing , &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
H-197	-0.3979300856590271	So it &apos;s not just a story of words .
H-198	-0.539409875869751	That &apos;s what we think of people when we call them with these words .
H-199	-0.4854849576950073	These are the values behind the words , and how we build these values .
H-200	-0.44154828786849976	Our language influence our thought and our way to see the world and see others .
H-201	-1.3940259218215942	In fact , a lot of anti @-@ verbal societies , whose Greeks and the Romans , believed that pronemorally , was very powerful , because to say the high @-@ voice thing .
H-202	-0.8750844597816467	So what do we want to do is , a person that is limited , or one person who has abilities ?
H-203	-1.607731819152832	In order to make something as simple as a person , a child , we could be fine and sit on their power .
H-204	-0.9683594107627869	Do we don &apos;t want to get the doors of the doors ?
H-205	-1.8431105613708496	One of these people , who opened me doors , was my pediatricia in the Institute of the Institute , and I &apos;ve got my pediat DupDuphave in Wiltton in the Delb .
H-206	-1.0269759893417358	His name is Dr. Pizzutillo .
H-207	-0.556635856628418	A American @-@ American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult to say for most Americans , then he became Dr. P .
H-208	-1.4245527982711792	And Dr. , I still had a very colorful kds and had the most perfect character to work with children .
H-209	-0.8837975263595581	I &apos;ve almost loved the time I spent in this hospital , at the exception of my therapy sessions .
H-210	-1.716565489768982	I had to do what seemed to me a minable @-@ to @-@ the @-@ way @-@ to @-@ the @-@ way @-@ to @-@ the @-@ way @-@ to @-@ the @-@ way @-@ to @-@ your @-@ legs @-@ to @-@ the @-@ way @-@ to @-@ the @
H-211	-1.1444010734558105	And I hated these eltics more than everything .
H-212	-0.7743011116981506	I hated them , I insulin them . I hate them .
H-213	-1.0184425115585327	And you know , I &apos;ve already negotied , at five years , with Dr. P to try to do more doing these things , obviously without success .
H-214	-0.9234998822212219	And one day he came to my session -- the exhausted and without pity -- and he said , &quot; Wahor . Aimee , you &apos;re really a little strong girl , and powerful , I think you &apos;re going to break one of these eltics .
H-215	-0.551900327205658	When you break it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
H-216	-0.9845771789550781	Of course , it was just a researcher of Dr. P &apos;s part of order to do these exercises that I didn &apos;t want to do in the perspective of becoming a five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the floor , but what it really did for me , it was to turn a very personal event in a new and promising experience .
H-217	-0.8672813177108765	And I &apos;m asking me today , what it &apos;s a vision , and the fact that he &apos;d declared me a little strong and powerful girl , drew my own vision of me far in the future , as a person by strong , powerful and athetic .
H-218	-0.6523836255073547	It &apos;s an example of how adults , in position of power , can wake up the power of a child .
H-219	-0.9765172004699707	But , in the previous previous examples of these dictionymy dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to evolve in the reality that we all want to be , the possibility for a individual to be able to be able .
H-220	-0.8608754873275757	Our language didn &apos;t follow the changes of our society , that many have been brought by technology .
H-222	-0.8138024806976318	So perhaps that technology reveals more clearly now what &apos;s always been : that everybody has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and the ability to human adaptation is our biggest asset .
H-223	-0.8038302063941956	The human ability to adapt , it &apos;s interesting , because people always wanted to talk to me to overcome the adversity , and I &apos;m going to do a confu .
H-224	-0.6453973650932312	This sentence never like me and I &apos;m always embarrassed when you ask questions about this theme , and I think I &apos;m starting to understand why .
H-226	-0.5144539475440979	But in fact , we &apos;re changed . We &apos;re tagged , of course , by a challenge , that it &apos;s physically , emotionally , or two .
H-227	-0.4423332214355469	And I want to say it &apos;s a good thing .
H-228	-0.9426462054252625	The adversity isn &apos;t a obstacle that we &apos;ve got to get to get the course of our life .
H-229	-0.34741368889808655	It &apos;s part of our life .
H-230	-0.48454490303993225	And I tend to see it like my shadow .
H-231	-0.6500813961029053	Sometimes I see it in large , sometimes in small , but it &apos;s always with me .
H-232	-0.8849255442619324	And of course , I &apos;m not trying to get the impact of the impact , the weight , of one person .
H-233	-0.6816907525062561	There &apos;s adversity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s very real and related to every person , but the question is not if you &apos;re going to go and meet the adversity , but how you go to meet it .
H-234	-0.822052538394928	So , our responsibility isn &apos;t simply to protect the adversity that we like , but for prepare for them for the height .
H-235	-0.8103259205818176	And we don &apos;t get service to our children when we do them feel that they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
H-236	-0.982775092124939	There &apos;s a difference and a important distinction between the medical medical fact that I &apos;m going to go out and the social social opinion of saying whether or not I &apos;m disabled .
H-237	-0.8702552318572998	And really , the only real and repeated disability that I &apos;ve had to face is that the world always thinks I could match these definitions .
H-238	-1.086959958076477	In our desire to protect the ones that we like to give them the truth and the cold truth , or , in fact , a merot on the quality of life that they can expect , we need to ensure that we don &apos;t ask the first brick of a wall that &apos;s really going to disabled a person .
H-239	-0.7525044083595276	Maybe the existing model , to look at what it &apos;s broken in you and how we &apos;re going to fix it , if it &apos;s more disabled for the individual as pathology itself .
H-240	-1.130426049232483	It &apos;s not taking the person in his integrity , not grateful the potential , we &apos;re creating another disease in more than any natural evidence that it can already have .
H-241	-0.97242271900177	We &apos;re really doing people in their value for our community .
H-242	-0.6382272839546204	So we have to see beyond pathology and in the range of human capabilities .
H-243	-0.873651921749115	And , more importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between these unperceive and the best of our creative capacity .
H-244	-1.2863882780075073	It &apos;s not about minimize , or nier , these little bit of moments like something to avoid or to get away , but instead of finding the chances in the adversity .
H-245	-1.1334902048110962	So maybe the idea that I want to do is , not so to defeat the adversity , that we open up to her , the enlaer , fight with her , to use a term term , maybe even dance with her .
H-246	-0.9855901002883911	And , maybe , if we see the adversity like natural , regular and useful , the presence we &apos;re less a burden .
H-247	-0.7645573616027832	And this year was a year of Charles Darwin &apos;s birthday , and it was 150 years ago , when he wrote about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , a truth on the human character .
H-248	-0.7795959711074829	To paraphraser , it &apos;s not the most strong of the species that &apos;s living , or the most intelligent , that &apos;s the most able to adapt to change .
H-249	-0.7125169038772583	The conflict is the genesis of creation .
H-250	-0.7780538201332092	From the work of Darwin , among others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and prove &apos;s driven by the struggle of human mind , through the conflict , to transformation .
H-251	-0.6421923637390137	So again , transformation , adaptation , are the biggest gift of the man .
H-252	-0.7138184309005737	And maybe , as we &apos;re not put to the proof , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made .
H-253	-0.5412336587905884	Maybe that &apos;s what adversity offers us , a sense of ourselves , a sense of our own power .
H-254	-0.5318018198013306	So we can do a gift .
H-255	-1.19448721408844	We can reimagine the adversity like something more than just difficult time .
H-256	-0.686251163482666	We can see it as change .
H-257	-1.0094958543777466	The adversity is just a change that we &apos;re not even adapted .
H-258	-0.6828516125679016	I think the biggest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is the idea of normal .
H-259	-0.5990004539489746	So , who is normal ?
H-260	-0.4249827563762665	There &apos;s no normal .
H-261	-0.5100207924842834	There &apos;s the common . There &apos;s typical . There &apos;s no normal .
H-262	-0.8822447657585144	And you would want to meet this poor person beige if she existed ?
H-263	-0.36255931854248047	I don &apos;t think .
H-264	-0.7558323740959167	If we can change this paradigm , of the idea of doing the normal , in the possibility , or the power , to be even a little bit more dangerous , we can release the power of so many other children , and invite them to exploit their rare and precious talents , in the community .
H-265	-0.48108989000320435	The anthropologists tell us that the only thing we have , as humans , always asked the members of our communities , is to be useful , to be able to contribute .
H-266	-1.108220100402832	We &apos;ve got the evidence that the men &apos;s men , 60 years ago , they had their ainings and the ones that were locked , and , maybe , because the experience of a life to survive , in these people , had their value for the community : they didn &apos;t see these people like beaved and inuseful , they would see them as rare and valuable .
H-267	-0.7467512488365173	A few years ago , I was in a market in the city where I grew up in this red area in the North degree of Pennsylvania , and I stood on top of a bowl of tomats .
H-268	-1.5305203199386597	It was the summer . I was going to be a shot .
H-269	-0.4411134719848633	I hear this guy , his voice behind me , &quot; Tians , if it &apos;s not Aimee Mullins . &quot;
H-270	-0.6116716861724854	And I &apos;m going to go back , and there &apos;s this gentleman . I have no idea that is .
H-271	-0.5742262601852417	And I said , &quot; Sorw , sir , we know ? I don &apos;t remember you . &quot;
H-272	-0.49279195070266724	He said , &quot; Well , you can &apos;t remember to have met .
H-273	-0.8397886157035828	I mean , when we met , I went to the belly of your mother . &quot;
H-274	-0.446637898683548	Oh , this guy .
H-275	-0.7175191044807434	And , of course , I &apos;ve tilted .
H-276	-0.4924931526184082	This gentleman was Dr. Kean , a man that I had known through my mother &apos;s stories on this day , because , of course , typical , I had two weeks of late on the day of my birth .
H-277	-0.8676587343215942	And so my mother &apos;s prenatal doctor was left , and the man who put me to the world was a complete stranger for my parents .
H-278	-0.6880314350128174	And , as I was born without tibia , and I had the feet into the inside , and a few toes on this foot , and a few toes on this foot , he had to be the porter , that stranger had to be the porter of the bad news .
H-279	-0.9079681038856506	He said , &quot; I &apos;ve had to give it to your parents that you &apos;d never work , and you &apos;d never have this kind of mobility that have the other kids or no kind of independence in life , and you &apos;ve done me a lier for this day . &quot;
H-281	-0.5491135120391846	And he &apos;s called this part of the course , the X @-@ ray , the potential of human will .
H-282	-1.0138335227966309	None of them can represent how much it can be a powerful determining in the quality of somebody &apos;s life .
H-283	-0.8960554599761963	And Dr. . Kean continued to tell me , he said , &quot; On my experience , at least we don &apos;t repeat the opposite , and by having the minimum of support , if we leave it , a child &apos;s child . &quot;
H-284	-0.955707848072052	See , Dr. . Kean has changed his way to think .
H-285	-0.5038570165634155	He understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what one person can do .
H-286	-0.934029757976532	And my way of thinking has changed with time , in the sense that , if you asked me the question 15 years ago , whether I would have changed my prosls against legs and bone , I wouldn &apos;t have a second .
H-287	-1.2259677648544312	At that time I &apos;m looking at this kind of normal .
H-288	-0.6622600555419922	If you ask me today , I &apos;m not as safe .
H-289	-0.7454153895378113	And it &apos;s because I &apos;ve got with them , not despite the experience that I &apos;ve got with them .
H-290	-1.0606544017791748	And maybe , this change in me happened because I &apos;ve been exposed to more people who opened me out of people who have asked me a covered on it and sit down .
H-291	-0.5156359672546387	You see , everything you need is a person that shows you the epiphany of your own power , and you &apos;re part .
H-292	-0.8057945370674133	If you can give someone the key of its own power , the human mind is if you can do that and open the door to someone in a critical moment , you educate them in the best sense .
H-293	-0.8191275596618652	You learn them to open themselves the doors .
H-294	-1.1076581478118896	In fact , the exact meaning of the word &apos;s word comes from the &quot; eert . &quot;
H-295	-0.5939270257949829	She means , produce what &apos;s inside , reveal the potential .
H-296	-1.2158094644546509	So what potential do we want to reveal ?
H-297	-0.9142279624938965	A study was been done in the &apos; 60s in Britain when they &apos;re spending elementary school in polyvalent school .
H-298	-0.8009856939315796	It &apos;s called the flow of flow . It &apos;s called &quot; pisting &quot; here in the United States .
H-299	-0.9944065809249878	It &apos;s about to separate the students by note , B , C , D and D .
H-300	-0.7260113954544067	And students have the most difficult program , the best teachers , etc .
H-301	-1.217767596244812	So , they took , on a three @-@ month @-@ months period , a three @-@ month @-@ old period , they &apos;ve given A , they &apos;ve got A A , they were smart .
H-302	-0.6185279488563538	And at the end of three months , they had level of level .
H-303	-1.0014277696609497	And , of course , the shuttle side , the back to this study is that they took the students and they said they were a D level .
H-304	-0.39613738656044006	And that &apos;s what happened to the end of these three months .
H-305	-0.8973252177238464	Those who were in the corner , in school , in addition to the ones who had abandoned .
H-306	-1.1518242359161377	A essential point of this case of case is that teachers were also dups .
H-307	-0.5442785620689392	The teachers didn &apos;t know that we had a exchange .
H-308	-0.9570223093032837	And we &apos;ve just told them this is the students &apos;s students , here &apos;s the graduate students .
H-309	-0.6251481175422668	And that &apos;s the way they put to teach them and treat them .
H-310	-1.03952157497406	So , I think that the only true unability is a crushed mind , a mind that &apos;s crushed didn &apos;t hope .
H-311	-0.43967747688293457	It doesn &apos;t see beauty .
H-312	-1.2805105447769165	It &apos;s no longer our natural curiosity , it &apos;s like our ability to imagine .
H-313	-0.9337916374206543	If instead , we can support a human mind to keep it , that it sees beauty in itself and in others , that it &apos;s curious and imaginative , then we use our power to good escient .
H-314	-0.3733229637145996	When a mind has these qualities , we &apos;re able to create new realities and new ways of being .
H-315	-0.7763293981552124	I &apos;d like to leave you with a poem of a poet named 14 @-@ century poet , called Hafiz I &apos;ve talked about my friend Jacques Tomorwoods .
H-316	-0.45335283875465393	And the poem is called &quot; The God who knows four words . &quot;
H-317	-0.679905354976654	&quot; Every child has known God , not the God &apos;s God , not the God of &quot; don &apos;t do , &quot; but the God who don &apos;t do four words and repeat them , who says , &quot; Come to me with me with me .
H-318	-0.8577587008476257	Thank you . For a time , I &apos;m interested in the placebo effect , which may be weird for a magician as a magicia , unless you &apos;re looking at the thing like me , either , &quot; something wrong can be so credible that it becomes something true . &quot;
H-319	-0.41170310974121094	In other words , sugar pills have measurable effects in some kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what happens is a pharmaceutical effect .
H-320	-0.6417896747589111	For the pain of pain , for example , if they believe enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in their body that we call the placebo effect .
H-321	-1.1233975887298584	Something of a difference becomes something real because of somebody &apos;s perception .
H-322	-0.9904400706291199	As we understand , I &apos;m going to show you something that &apos;s going to be , a very simple magic trick .
H-323	-0.6062899827957153	I &apos;m going to show you how it works . It &apos;s a trick that &apos;s been in all of the magic books for children for the &apos; 50s .
H-324	-1.2434078454971313	I &apos;ve got myself learned from the Cub Scder in the &apos; 70s .
H-325	-0.7528837323188782	I &apos;m going to do it , then you explain it .
H-326	-0.6583947539329529	I &apos;ll explain why I &apos;ve explained to you .
H-327	-0.5267120599746704	That &apos;s what happens .
H-328	-0.6249326467514038	The knife , you can look at ; my hand , you can look at .
H-329	-0.7722302079200745	I &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my hair like this .
H-330	-1.4574331045150757	I &apos;m going to get my sledy .
H-331	-0.7908524870872498	To be sure there &apos;s nothing in mine , I &apos;m just going to shake my wrist and here .
H-332	-1.1266800165176392	As that you can see that at any point what it can &apos;t happen . As long as I &apos;re not going to get out of my mant .
H-333	-0.6985562443733215	The object of this trick is pretty simple .
H-334	-0.973380446434021	I &apos;m going to open my hand , hoping , if it &apos;s going to be well , that my animal magnetism will keep the knife in place .
H-335	-1.0228400230407715	In fact , it &apos;s so good that I can just put it and the knife doesn &apos;t fall .
H-336	-1.183574914932251	There &apos;s not going to come out of my manche , no thing . You can look at it .
H-337	-0.6073232889175415	Ta @-@ da !
H-338	-0.7474359273910522	That &apos;s a trick that I &apos;m often teaching young kids who are interested in the magic , because you can learn bad things on the illusion in a methodological way -- even if it &apos;s a very simple trick .
H-339	-0.6431633830070496	There &apos;s probably a lot of people in the room who know this tower .
H-340	-0.5267120599746704	That &apos;s what happens .
H-341	-0.5586476922035217	I want the knife in my hand .
H-342	-0.802837073802948	I &apos;m saying I &apos;m going to hold my wrist and to be sure that nothing is not going to go out of my sledy . It &apos;s a lie .
H-343	-0.4475100338459015	The reason I want my wrist , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
H-344	-1.2188045978546143	At the time when my hand &apos;s map of you to get away , it &apos;s just right here , my index , happening from where it &apos;s in a position like this .
H-345	-0.9072246551513672	Not bad .
H-346	-0.48955613374710083	There &apos;s somebody who didn &apos;t have childhood here .
H-347	-0.6477261781692505	So it &apos;s like this , here , here .
H-348	-0.737421452999115	When I move , my finger changes .
H-349	-0.5596044063568115	We could talk about why it &apos;s a illusion , why you don &apos;t notice that there &apos;s only three fingers here , because the mind , in the way he has to treat information , it doesn &apos;t account , two , three .
H-350	-0.6666063070297241	It &apos;s not really the subject . Here , I open my hand .
H-351	-1.3875641822814941	Apparently it &apos;s doing , not by magnetism , but by deception , my index being here .
H-352	-1.3669456243515015	After when I farm my finger , the same way , I &apos;m going to go up : this Civil movement of a certain way the decision of the finger .
H-353	-0.6426775455474854	I take this hand . I &apos;ll give you the knife .
H-354	-0.5065645575523376	It &apos;s a trick that you can do to your friends and neighbors . Thank you .
H-355	-0.8557670712471008	Now , what did it see with the placebo effect ?
H-356	-0.6680312752723694	I read a study , there &apos;s about a year that really opened me the mind .
H-357	-0.7925694584846497	I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so that , for me , it was a ahurous thing .
H-358	-0.955928385257721	It turns out that if you administrate a placebo under the form of a white compressed , it &apos;s like the form of a vacuum , it &apos;s just a white and round , it &apos;s a measurable effect .
H-359	-0.8679561018943787	If you change the form of the placebo , like for example a smaller compressed , and blue color , with a letter letter , it &apos;s actually more effective in measurable way .
H-360	-1.0434179306030273	Well , any of the two products is a drug -- it &apos;s a sugar of sugar .
H-361	-1.5232137441635132	But it &apos;s not as a white crah is not as good as a blue crah .
H-362	-1.174674391746521	What ? It &apos;s stuck me .
H-363	-0.37471288442611694	It turns out that it doesn &apos;t stop there .
H-364	-0.832180380821228	If you have gelules , they &apos;re more effective than the pills under all the shapes .
H-365	-0.9124748110771179	A colored gelule , which is yellow from one side and red from the other , is better than a white gelule .
H-366	-0.7901310920715332	The dowise has something to see with this .
H-367	-0.932867705821991	A pills and two times a day is not as good as three pills ... I don &apos;t remember more statistics -- sorry .
H-368	-0.7679468393325806	What I want to say ,
H-369	-1.2000011205673218	It &apos;s the dowise have something to see with this .
H-370	-0.880436897277832	The shape is also for something .
H-371	-0.4436884820461273	If you want the ultimate placebo , you have the needle .
H-372	-1.0393611192703247	A needle with something of inerte , a couple of inches of something that you &apos;re injecting in the patient .
H-373	-0.8616682291030884	It &apos;s a so powerful image in his mind , it &apos;s so much stronger than the white vessels .
H-374	-0.7128868699073792	The graph , I &apos;m going to show you to another moment when you &apos;ll have slides .
H-375	-0.7081393003463745	What I mean is that the white compressed is not as good as blue &apos;s blue , which is not as good as gelule , which is not as good as the needle .
H-376	-1.4969067573547363	There &apos;s no real real pharmaceutical quality .
H-377	-0.7430674433708191	It &apos;s just your belief that makes it real in your body and gives a more strong effect .
H-378	-0.4798257350921631	I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it a magic trick .
H-379	-1.0426554679870605	Let &apos;s make something that &apos;s apparently a little trick and give him the appearance of reality .
H-380	-0.6739011406898499	We know about this study that , when you want the reality , you take the needle .
H-381	-0.7856258749961853	Here &apos;s a 18 @-@ inch @-@ inch . It &apos;s very sharp .
H-382	-1.0898687839508057	I &apos;m just going to get the sterilize a little bit .
H-383	-0.8546264171600342	It &apos;s really my flesh . It &apos;s not the flesth that &apos;s going to grow .
H-384	-0.5029462575912476	It &apos;s my skin right there . It &apos;s not a special effect of Hollywood .
H-385	-0.694943368434906	I &apos;m going to drill my skin and spend this needle through the other side .
H-386	-0.9102189540863037	If you don &apos;t support the view of the blood , if you fall in the apples easily -- I was doing this tower at friends in my last hotel room at some people that I didn &apos;t know , and a lady almost turned out of the eye --
H-387	-0.4540976583957672	if you &apos;re sensitive , look at the next 30 seconds . In fact , you know what , I &apos;m going to do the hard part behind .
H-388	-0.5850580334663391	You can see , but you can also look at the way .
H-389	-0.6735976934432983	So , here &apos;s what &apos;s going on , just here , the beginning of my flesh in the lower part of the arm , I &apos;m just going to drill a little bit .
H-390	-0.605996310710907	I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m afraid ?
H-391	-0.805614173412323	And then a little bit about my skin , it &apos;s coming out of the other side like this .
H-392	-0.7683506011962891	We &apos;re basically in the same situation that with the knife of the knife .
H-393	-1.1057626008987427	It &apos;s kind of .
H-394	-0.48082882165908813	You can &apos;t count my fingers here ?
H-395	-0.4915177822113037	Let me show you . Here &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
H-396	-0.8956777453422546	Yes , good ...
H-397	-0.6616957783699036	I know what people say when they see that .
H-398	-0.6118577718734741	They &apos;re doing , &quot; It &apos;s not enough to plant things through the skin for a few minutes . &quot;
H-399	-0.6431444883346558	Let me give you a glimpse .
H-400	-0.899391233921051	What does it look like ? No wrong .
H-401	-0.3218423128128052	Yeah , I know .
H-402	-0.5781410336494446	The people &apos;s people say , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t really saw this . &quot;
H-403	-1.1069700717926025	The people in the middle room are starting to go into our own .
H-404	-0.760587751865387	Let me show you about close .
H-405	-0.4083660840988159	It &apos;s really my skin . It &apos;s not a special effect of Hollywood .
H-406	-0.6935630440711975	It &apos;s my flesh and I can turn .
H-407	-0.49936190247535706	I &apos;m sorry . If you feel wrong , look else , don &apos;t look at that .
H-408	-0.8780165910720825	The people &apos;s people or those who will look at the video video later will say , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s not wrong the kind of effect there , but if it was true , see , there &apos;s a hole here and , if it was true , it was going to be . &quot;
H-409	-0.6047496199607849	Well , let me take you a little bit of blood .
H-410	-0.9324727058410645	Yeah , that &apos;s this .
H-411	-0.90702885389328	Normally , I should take the needle .
H-412	-0.8983620405197144	I &apos;m going to show my arm and I would show you that there &apos;s no injury , but I think in this context and in the idea of taking something to make something and make it real , I &apos;m just going to leave it like this and leave the stage .
H-413	-0.9491146802902222	We &apos;ll see several times these next days .
H-414	-0.450314462184906	I hope you &apos;re going to want it . Thank you very much . My name is Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a games .
H-415	-0.7387630939483643	I &apos;m creating online games for 10 years now .
H-416	-0.7259408831596375	My goal for the 10 years to come out is to do it &apos;s also easy to save the world in the reality that it &apos;s in the online games .
H-417	-0.841018795967102	For that , I have a plan that involves to convince more people , including you , to spend more time to play more larger and better games .
H-418	-0.586848795413971	Today we spend three billion hours a week to play online .
H-419	-0.4423769414424896	Some here can think , &quot; It &apos;s a lot of time on games . &quot;
H-420	-1.188252568244934	Maybe too too , especially in terms of the number of urgent problems to solve in the real world .
H-421	-0.6512576341629028	But in fact , after my research , in the Institute for the Futur , the reality is exactly the opposite .
H-422	-0.5325486660003662	Three billion hours a week are not enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
H-423	-1.1080007553100586	In the contrary , I think that if we want to survive over a hundred years on Earth , we have to increase this huge number .
H-424	-0.8453981876373291	I calculated that the total necessary is 21 billion hours of play a week .
H-425	-0.7772675156593323	It &apos;s perhaps an intuitive @-@ intuitive idea , so I &apos;m going to resay , let &apos;s look at this more close .
H-426	-0.6447973847389221	If we want to solve problems like famine , poverty , climate change , conflicts , obesity , I think we &apos;ve got to do to play online at least 21 billion hours per week .
H-427	-0.6485797166824341	If if I &apos;m serious . It &apos;s serious .
H-428	-0.8002461791038513	Here &apos;s why . This is pretty good why I think games are also essential for the survival of human species . Really .
H-429	-1.0991677045822144	Here &apos;s a portrait taken by the Phil Toledance .
H-430	-0.6543145179748535	He wanted to capture the emotion of the player .
H-431	-1.144100546836853	For that , he put a camera shot in front of the players for the way they &apos;re playing .
H-432	-0.4334067702293396	This is a classic emotion for a player .
H-433	-0.8448613882064819	If you &apos;re not a player , you &apos;re going to go to the certain nuances .
H-434	-0.7271332740783691	You may see the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but especially intense concentration , very very intense concentration to solve a really difficult problem .
H-435	-0.7585673332214355	If you &apos;re a player , you &apos;ll notice a few nuances , you &apos;ll notice a little bit about the eyes , and around the mouth that is a sign of optimism .
H-436	-1.5536290407180786	The eyebrows , they &apos;re making a surprise .
H-437	-0.7345473766326904	Here &apos;s a player on the point of living what we call a &#91; unclear &#91; unclear &#93; .
H-438	-0.5433230996131897	You &apos;ve heard about it . OK .
H-439	-0.7169473767280579	So we have some players among us .
H-440	-1.0906985998153687	One victory is a very extraordinarily positive outcome that you don &apos;t even have the idea that it was possible before to reach .
H-441	-0.7238641381263733	It &apos;s almost beyond the limits of imagination .
H-442	-0.6606292128562927	When you &apos;ve reached it , you &apos;re shocked to discover what you &apos;re really able to do . It &apos;s a heroic victory .
H-443	-1.1877890825271606	Here &apos;s a player on the point to give a victory victory .
H-444	-0.7934854626655579	Here &apos;s the face that we need to see about millions of people everywhere in the world at the moment that we &apos;re facing the problems of the century to come .
H-445	-1.4468506574630737	The face of somebody who , against all , is on the point to give you an heroic victory .
H-446	-1.0176323652267456	Unfortunately , we see more that face every day when we &apos;re going to face to the future problems .
H-447	-0.48693186044692993	That &apos;s what I call the face &quot; I like life . &quot;
H-448	-0.8799686431884766	Here &apos;s the mimic . Let &apos;s go . Okay . Okay . Okay .
H-449	-0.7703214883804321	It &apos;s still I &apos;ve got this face .
H-450	-0.5334781408309937	It &apos;s a graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , where I &apos;ve done my Ph.D. , &quot; why are we better at play that in life ? &quot;
H-451	-0.5023900270462036	It &apos;s a problem that a lot of players have .
H-452	-0.5627766847610474	We think we &apos;re not as good in life than in games .
H-453	-1.6263816356658936	Okay , not just just done , &quot; Well that it &apos;s part of it .
H-454	-0.9643524289131165	We &apos;re going to spend this stage in games . But , but good in the sense of motivated to do something that &apos;s about meaning , ready to collaborate and cooperate .
H-455	-0.8408595323562622	When we &apos;re in the game , I think a lot of us become the best version of ourselves , ready to help in a eye of eye , ready to tackle a problem as long as it &apos;s going to be , to get its failures and start .
H-456	-0.598240077495575	In the real life , in the failure , faced to obstacles , we &apos;re not often in this state of mind .
H-457	-1.5422241687774658	It &apos;s going to be gone .
H-458	-1.3678268194198608	It &apos;s just overwhelmed .
H-459	-0.8922230005264282	You feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or cync .
H-460	-0.6476573944091797	We &apos;ve never have these feelings when we play , they don &apos;t just exist .
H-461	-0.5483229160308838	That &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a student in the third cycle .
H-462	-1.267716646194458	What &apos;s in the games that do that we think we can be able to do it ?
H-463	-1.1266560554504395	How can we create these feelings of play in our daily work ?
H-464	-0.8329777717590332	I looked at games like the World of Warcraft , which is the archetype of the common resolution environment .
H-465	-1.7408596277236938	I &apos;ve started to notice the details that can make the heroic turies in the games .
H-466	-0.7430209517478943	The first idea : at the moment you put in one of these online games , especially in the World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that want to trust you , all of it , to do an incredible mission .
H-467	-0.8682665228843689	Not any one , but the one that corresponds to your level in the game . OK ?
H-468	-0.5445390343666077	You can do it .
H-469	-0.6580163240432739	They don &apos;t give you a challenge that you can &apos;t get .
H-470	-0.5847411155700684	But one that is at the limit of your capabilities . So , you &apos;ve got to work hard .
H-471	-0.43613186478614807	But there &apos;s no unemployment in the World of Warcraft .
H-472	-1.3400754928588867	Nobody &apos;s going to turn up the chicken .
H-473	-0.7488000988960266	There &apos;s always something about precise and important to do .
H-474	-0.43033918738365173	And also hundreds of collaborators .
H-475	-0.7697460651397705	Where you &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your mission .
H-476	-1.0549737215042114	It &apos;s not something current in real life , that feeling that it &apos;s a clear of fingers of the hundreds of collaborative collaborators .
H-477	-0.5651280283927917	And also there &apos;s this heroic story , the exciting story of our lives , and what we do .
H-478	-1.0132639408111572	We all get this positive feedback .
H-479	-0.7964566946029663	You &apos;ve already heard the &quot; Niar next &quot; and &quot; Levi+ 1 , &quot; &quot; Cligence + 1 . &quot;
H-480	-0.31350457668304443	We don &apos;t have this kind of information in life .
H-481	-0.6892013549804688	When I &apos;ll come from the stage , I don &apos;t have &quot; Discourse + 1 , &quot; or &quot; Idecrazy + 1 . &quot;
H-482	-0.5310996770858765	I don &apos;t have that back in life .
H-483	-1.3187354803085327	In the way , the problem with the virtual environments that &apos;s like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so gratifying to be in the point of the point to be a herheroic , that we decides to spend all our time in these virtual worlds .
H-484	-0.38847607374191284	It &apos;s just better than reality .
H-485	-0.9516862630844116	At this day , the players of Warcraft &apos;s players have collectively spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth .
H-486	-0.42233040928840637	It &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
H-487	-1.0191876888275146	It &apos;s like the opposite .
H-488	-1.1317685842514038	But let &apos;s put it in his context : there &apos;s 5.93 million years ago , our oldest primate ancestor put up .
H-489	-1.0316613912582397	He was the first primate .
H-490	-0.7606303095817566	When we &apos;re talking about the time we invest in this moment in games , the only way to address it , or even to think about it , is to talk about time to the scale of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
H-491	-0.8620994687080383	But it &apos;s just just . It looks like that time to play , we change our human ability of human beings .
H-492	-0.6990765929222107	We &apos;re becoming a more collaborative and honest species .
H-493	-0.48020970821380615	It &apos;s true . I think .
H-494	-0.9204561114311218	Let &apos;s look at this interesting statistic .
H-495	-1.2981213331222534	A University of the University University was published recently .
H-496	-0.9048634767532349	A young way of today in a high @-@ culture country country will have spent more than 10 hours to play online , at the age of 21 .
H-497	-0.5988227128982544	Ten hours is a interesting number of two titles .
H-498	-1.4049170017242432	First , for the children &apos;s children , 10 080 hours is the number of the number of five @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ two @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ year @-@ two @-@ two @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ two @-@ 2 @-@ hour number of the fourth @-@ 2 @-@ hour
H-499	-0.8948992490768433	So there &apos;s a parallel curriculum of education , in the course that young people learn the ruins to become a good player in the same way they learn all the rest to school .
H-500	-0.8532090187072754	Some here have maybe read the last book of Malcolm Gladwell &apos;s &quot; Cliers . &quot;
H-501	-0.6295826435089111	You &apos;ve probably heard about his success theory , the 10 @-@ hour theory .
H-502	-0.7791998982429504	It &apos;s based on a cognitive science research , &quot; if you &apos;re spending 10 hours to study seriously any before 21 years , you &apos;re going to be a virtuy . &quot;
H-503	-0.9119201898574829	You &apos;ll also be good at anything the best in the world .
H-504	-0.8141494989395142	So what we &apos;re seeing is a whole generation of young people who are the play of play .
H-505	-0.855271577835083	So the big question is , &quot; What can well use these play play ? &quot;
H-506	-1.191253423690796	If we knew to answer it , we would have virtually a lot of human human resources .
H-507	-0.7079641819000244	Here &apos;s how many people in the world have spent at least one hour per day to play online .
H-508	-1.135130763053894	It &apos;s the game of play .
H-509	-1.2849197387695312	500 million of these extraordinarily good people in something .
H-510	-0.6180695295333862	In the last 10 years , we &apos;ll have a billion new players that will be extraordinarily good at something .
H-511	-0.5861438512802124	In the case you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s going to happen .
H-512	-1.2725238800048828	The global game industry of low @-@ consumption @-@ to @-@ the @-@ consumption @-@ to @-@ the @-@ consumption @-@ to @-@ the @-@ SSM networks , which is allowing the players of the world , and especially in India , in China , to play online .
H-513	-0.6932681798934937	We &apos;re waiting for a new billion players in over 10 years .
H-514	-0.9830067157745361	What &apos;s going to be the number of 1.5 billion .
H-515	-1.1240109205245972	So I started thinking about what these games do we make virtuoits .
H-516	-0.9318417310714722	Here &apos;s my four conclusions . The first one : the exciting optimism .
H-517	-1.3344745635986328	Okay . Imagine this as a extreme @-@ efficient self @-@ dimensional self .
H-518	-1.1914616823196411	So , the exciting optimism is the willingness to act immediately to overcome a obstacle , associated with certainty of a reasonable hope of successful .
H-519	-0.6959105134010315	The players always believe that a victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth to try and try it now .
H-520	-0.8649758696556091	The players don &apos;t sit in not doing anything .
H-521	-0.7744428515434265	They &apos;re very strong to make a very dense social tissue .
H-522	-1.1479600667953491	There &apos;s a lot of interesting research show that we &apos;d like to be played with them , even if they &apos;ve got a lot of .
H-523	-0.7277121543884277	Why ? Because you have a great confidence to play with somebody .
H-524	-0.547558069229126	They &apos;re going to spend time with us , they &apos;re going to play the same rules , with the same goals , they &apos;re going to play until the game is done .
H-525	-1.0139853954315186	So , play together built out of the links , trust and collaboration .
H-526	-1.072128176689148	The result is that we &apos;re getting more strong social links .
H-527	-0.48901697993278503	A wonderful productivity . I love this idea .
H-528	-0.8984814882278442	You know that there &apos;s a reason why the player &apos;s average player &apos;s player &apos;s player &apos;s player &apos;s player &apos;s player .
H-529	-1.0510084629058838	It &apos;s because we know , when we play , that we &apos;re actually more happy to work hard , that we &apos;re going to get out of it .
H-530	-1.0467708110809326	We know that the human being is to its optimium when it &apos;s a difficult work , but it &apos;s a difficult work .
H-531	-0.8408163189888	The players are ready to work hard , all the time , if you &apos;re giving them the good mission .
H-532	-0.5999235510826111	And finally , a heroic sense .
H-533	-1.62073814868927	The love players would see a lot of motivated missions , missions in the scale of the planet .
H-534	-1.0557608604431152	A little bit of izz to put this in perspective .
H-535	-0.8345953226089478	You all know Wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
H-536	-0.8155367374420166	The second , in the world , with almost 2,000 articles is the World of Warcraft .
H-537	-0.5149695873260498	Five million people use it every month .
H-538	-0.8977574110031128	They &apos;ve got more information about the World of Warcraft on the Internet that any other subject that a wiki is for .
H-539	-0.5490251183509827	They &apos;re building a heroic story .
H-540	-0.9446108937263489	They &apos;re building a number of heroic knowledge on the World of Warcraft .
H-541	-0.8409846425056458	OK , here &apos;s the four @-@ powers four @-@ powers to a same goal .
H-542	-1.475247859954834	The players are full of hope and overpowerful individuals .
H-543	-1.0118731260299683	They &apos;re people who believe that they &apos;re able to be able to change the world .
H-544	-0.37985363602638245	The only problem is they believe they &apos;re able to change virtual worlds and not the real world .
H-545	-0.4087802767753601	This is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
H-546	-1.4900633096694946	Edward Castronomy is economist .
H-547	-0.7342398166656494	His work is impressive . It &apos;s interested in the reasons that grow people to invest as much time , energy and money in online games .
H-548	-0.749624490737915	He says , &quot; We &apos;re seeing a event that &apos;s a mass of mass to virtual worlds and online games environments . &quot;
H-549	-0.4403221309185028	It &apos;s a economist . And so a rational .
H-550	-0.532383918762207	And he says ...
H-551	-1.1358232498168945	not like me -- I &apos;m a games of games , exubous .
H-552	-0.5896471738815308	So he says it &apos;s perfectly logical , because the players can do more in the games that in the real world .
H-553	-0.6870511770248413	They can have more strong social relationships in games than in the real world .
H-554	-0.7833089232444763	They have a better return and feel more rewarted in the games that in real life .
H-555	-0.8430529236793518	That &apos;s why it &apos;s now that it &apos;s currently logic that players spend more time online than in the real world .
H-556	-1.1767425537109375	I think , I find that all of it as rational , right now .
H-557	-0.6356719732284546	But it &apos;s not , in any case , a optious situation .
H-558	-0.8586267232894897	We &apos;ve got to start to make the world more close to play .
H-559	-0.9444238543510437	I &apos;m inspired from a event that was 2500 years ago .
H-560	-1.1951161623001099	Here &apos;s old @-@ old , made out of sheep . OK ?
H-561	-1.479832649230957	Before these wonderful kind of play , existed the sheep &apos;s face .
H-562	-1.6911593675613403	They &apos;re looking at the first game @-@ like @-@ the @-@ play game of human beings .
H-563	-0.46111389994621277	If you &apos;re familiar with the work of the Greek historian , Herodote , you may know this story .
H-564	-0.5768089294433594	The story of which invented the game and why .
H-565	-1.1893162727355957	Herodot said that the games , especially the &#91; the &#93; the &#93; in &#93; the &#93; the &#93; of &#93; of &#93; of &#93; .
H-566	-0.8542582988739014	Apparently , famine was so serious that Lydie &apos;s king king that they had to do something unexpected .
H-567	-1.0440832376480103	People would go . They &apos;re fighting .
H-568	-0.7613531947135925	The situation was desperate . They needed an desperate solution .
H-569	-1.18989098072052	And after Herodote , they invented them and they &apos;ve got a law in all the kingdom .
H-570	-0.4351014792919159	The first day , everybody could eat .
H-571	-0.5197742581367493	The next day , everybody had to play .
H-572	-1.0382896661758423	They &apos;d be so focused on their game game -- games are so immersed and we &apos;re putting in such a successful productivity -- that they would forget they had nothing to eat .
H-573	-0.6597658395767212	And so , the next day , they &apos;re playing .
H-574	-0.6659270524978638	And the next day they would eat .
H-575	-1.0869718790054321	In the afternoon , after Herodote , 18 years ago , they &apos;re flying in famine , eating a day , and playing the next day .
H-576	-0.3712711036205292	I think that &apos;s exactly what we do today .
H-577	-0.8471766114234924	We &apos;re playing to escape to the suffering of the world .
H-578	-0.9104021787643433	We &apos;re playing to move away from all that &apos;s not going to be in the real life , everything that &apos;s not satisfying , and we get the game that we need .
H-579	-0.6952219605445862	But we don &apos;t have to stop us there .
H-580	-0.32641738653182983	It &apos;s really interesting .
H-581	-0.8892883062362671	And after Herodote , after 18 years , famine was always present . So , the king decided they would play a last time to the time .
H-582	-1.0389389991760254	They divided the kingdom in two .
H-583	-1.0713800191879272	They &apos;d played a time to them , and the winners would be right to their heroic adventure .
H-584	-0.9374310970306396	They would leave the Lydie , and would look at a new place to live , leaving the number of people to live on the resources available , and hoping to move their civilization to a place where she could proish .
H-585	-0.918063759803772	It &apos;s amazing , right ?
H-586	-1.048801302909851	But recently , DNA evidence have shown that the Ltrusics , who led to the Empire Romain , share the same DNA that ancient Lydians .
H-587	-0.5173173546791077	Recently , scientists have suggested that the incredible story of Herodote is actually true .
H-588	-1.103971242904663	Ingeologists have found evidence of a global cooling that took about 20 years that could explain famine .
H-589	-0.7221184372901917	So this amazing story could be true .
H-590	-1.1638725996017456	They could actually saved their culture in playing , it &apos;s going to spread in the game for 18 years , then being so inspired , and knowing if well how to be toughed by the game that they saved their civilization .
H-591	-0.4197678864002228	We also can do it .
H-592	-0.8821282982826233	We &apos;re playing Warcraft for 1994 .
H-593	-0.9257600903511047	It was the first @-@ time strategy of the World series of Warcraft . It was 16 years back .
H-594	-0.8609193563461304	They &apos;ve played the time for 18 years , we &apos;re playing Warcraft for 16 years .
H-595	-0.3493134379386902	I think we &apos;re ready for our heroic game .
H-596	-0.8555099964141846	They &apos;ve shared their civilization in two for a new world .
H-597	-0.8283482193946838	That &apos;s how I get to my 21 billion hours of play a week .
H-598	-1.0697171688079834	We need half of us to get a hour by day to play , until we &apos;re solving real problems .
H-599	-0.6823772192001343	I know you &apos;re saying , &quot; How are we going to solve real problems in playing ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing my work for the last few years , at the Institute for the Futur .
H-600	-0.8551011681556702	We have this banniage in our offices in Palo Alto , and it &apos;s going to make our way to address the future .
H-601	-0.2985302209854126	We don &apos;t want to try to predict the future .
H-602	-0.7350864410400391	What we want to do is invent the future .
H-603	-0.7611567378044128	We want to imagine the best result possible . And we want to get all the world to make this real result .
H-604	-1.6288526058197021	We want to want to illustrate a heroic , and give people the ways to do one .
H-605	-0.5787568092346191	I &apos;m going to show you quickly three games that I invented as attempt to give people the ways to create this victory in their own future .
H-606	-1.1501134634017944	Here &apos;s the world &apos;s world .
H-607	-0.5942699313163757	We invented it in 2007 .
H-608	-0.7854704856872559	It &apos;s a online game in which you &apos;re trying to survive to a gas shortage .
H-609	-1.0093990564346313	The shortage of essence is clear , but we &apos;ve got enough enough content that you believe that it &apos;s true and to live as it &apos;s no more gasoline . When you start the game , you &apos;re feeling , you &apos;re telling you where you &apos;re living .
H-610	-1.0287930965423584	And then you get real time in real time , information wires that show you how much costs exactly the essence , what &apos;s inavailable , how food production is affected , how the transportation is , if schools are closed , if there &apos;s riots .
H-611	-0.7816439270973206	You &apos;ve got to tell you to live your real life as if this was true . And we &apos;re asking you to tell you , to send videos , pictures .
H-612	-0.6413317322731018	We &apos;ve tested this game with 1700 players in 2007 .
H-613	-0.8129505515098572	We &apos;re following them for three years .
H-614	-0.7962653636932373	I can guarantee you that it &apos;s a experiment that makes you .
H-615	-0.5993158221244812	No one wants to change his lifestyle to improve the world , or because we should do it .
H-616	-0.5866004228591919	But if you &apos;re immersed in a heroic adventure and hear , &quot; We don &apos;t have more gas . &quot;
H-617	-0.769652783870697	It becomes a extraordinary story and a journey to live .
H-618	-1.042405605316162	You &apos;re going to see how you will survive .
H-619	-1.2575894594192505	Most of the players have conserved the moral habits in this game .
H-620	-0.9569416642189026	So , for the next game to save the world , we decided to get a more high problem , bigger than the lack of gasoline .
H-621	-0.8268575072288513	We &apos;ve created the game &quot; Supert &quot; at the Institute for the Futur .
H-622	-0.7272410988807678	The subject was : a super @-@ computer has calculated that humans had more than 23 years to live on Earth .
H-623	-1.3962581157684326	This computer is called the System &apos;s System &apos;s System .
H-624	-1.1431324481964111	We asked people to come out like a film of Jerry Bruckheimer .
H-625	-0.8442530035972595	You know his movies , you &apos;re making a dream team .
H-626	-0.6720994710922241	There &apos;s the astronaut , the scientist , the old prisoner , each one has his mission to save the world .
H-627	-0.600682258605957	But in our game , instead of having five people in the team , we say that all the world are going on , your mission is to invent the future of the future , the future of the future , the health of the future , the security of the future and social protection of the future .
H-628	-1.0888121128082275	There &apos;s 8,000 people who played it for eight weeks .
H-629	-0.9181034564971924	They &apos;ve imagined 500 creative solutions that you can find on the Internet in taping &quot; Supert &quot; in Google .
H-630	-0.7344700694084167	Finally , the last game . We &apos;re looking at three March . It &apos;s a game game with the World Bank Institute .
H-631	-1.1005685329437256	If you end up the game , you &apos;ll be certified by the World Bank , like Innovator &apos;s World ator .
H-632	-0.7152397036552429	We &apos;re working with the universities of Sub @-@ Saharian Africa . We incentives them to acquire social innovation skills .
H-633	-0.942523717880249	There &apos;s a comic book , different levels of local studies , in the network of knowledge , sustainable development , vision and resource .
H-634	-0.5916808843612671	I &apos;d like to ask you to share this game with young world , especially in developing areas , which could benefit from this collaboration to start to imagine their own social companies to save the world .
H-635	-0.8272879719734192	I &apos;m going to summarize it up .
H-636	-0.38992980122566223	I have a question .
H-637	-0.4090748727321625	What do you think it &apos;s going to happen ?
H-638	-0.5564248561859131	There are all these incredible players , there are these games that serve pilots of what we could do , but none of them has saved the world .
H-639	-0.5857996344566345	Well , I hope you &apos;re going to agree with me to say that players are a resource resource to do tasks in the real world , that games are a powerful way for change .
H-640	-0.9514008164405823	We all have these amazing superpowers , this wonderful productivity , the possibility of a strong social link , that sense of optimism , and the desire of a heroic sense of our lives .
H-641	-0.8055506348609924	I really hope we &apos;re going to bring us to play some useful games , to survive over 100 years on this planet .
H-642	-1.0001956224441528	My wish is that you &apos;d come back to create such games and play .
H-643	-0.5679605603218079	When I look at 10 years to come , I &apos;m sure two things : we can create any future that we &apos;re thinking about , and we can play games that we want .
H-644	-1.1031337976455688	What the games that will change the world are starting .
H-645	-0.27594879269599915	Thank you . I &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate .
H-646	-0.9518346786499023	And it can seem a little bit surprising because my work @-@ time work in the Foundation is rather for vaccines and semences , the things that we have to invent and distribute to help the two billion more poor billion to live better .
H-647	-0.5521609783172607	But energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than for anyone on the planet .
H-648	-0.8970139622688293	The climate is deteriorating , which means that there &apos;s a lot of years where their crops will not grow .
H-649	-0.7528958320617676	There &apos;s too much rain , or not enough rain .
H-650	-0.8039389252662659	Things are going to evolve in directions that their fragile environment can &apos;t support .
H-651	-0.6132591962814331	And it leads to famine . It leads to uncertainty . It leads to disorders .
H-652	-0.6009765863418579	The climate changes will be terrible for them .
H-653	-0.3557417690753937	The price of energy , also , is very important for them .
H-654	-0.662828266620636	In fact , if you couldn &apos;t get the price of one thing , to reduce poverty , it would be , from far , the energy .
H-655	-1.0756670236587524	Now , the price of energy went down to the time .
H-656	-0.8498557806015015	Really , the advances of civilization are based on energy advances .
H-657	-0.7684377431869507	The coal revolution has made the industrial revolution , and , even in the &apos; 9s , we &apos;ve witnessed a very fast decrease of the price of electricity , and that &apos;s because we have refrigerators , air conditioning , that we can make modern materials and make so much things .
H-658	-0.7531875967979431	In the rich world , it &apos;s fine to electricity .
H-659	-1.2228184938430786	But , at the same time that we &apos;re in the price -- and it &apos;s left to divide it by two -- we need to answer a new constrte , and this is a bit of CO2 .
H-660	-0.7619055509567261	The CO2 gets the planet , and the equation on CO2 is actually very simple .
H-661	-0.7337550520896912	If you take the total carbon CO2 , it leads to a temperature increase , and this rise of temperature led to very negative effects .
H-662	-0.47127118706703186	The effects on weather and maybe worse , indirect effects , because natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to these fast changes , and then we see the collapse of these ecosystems .
H-663	-0.9848048090934753	It &apos;s true that on the normal figures , which temperature will be , from what CO2 increase , and what we &apos;re going to have positive effects , there &apos;s a certain uncertainty , but not a lot .
H-664	-0.5954384803771973	And if we don &apos;t know exactly the degree of gravity of these effects , we know they &apos;re going to be extremely serious .
H-665	-1.0280036926269531	In several times , I asked the high @-@ level scientists to really go down to close to zero ?
H-666	-1.0692416429519653	Don &apos;t we just decrease half of half or the quarter ?
H-667	-0.8160876035690308	And the answer is that , until we &apos;re getting zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
H-668	-0.45336973667144775	And so it &apos;s a great challenge .
H-669	-0.8065352439880371	It &apos;s very different than saying that we &apos;re a truck of a three @-@ foot truck trying to spend under a three @-@ foot bridge , and that we &apos;re going to find the way of it .
H-670	-0.6313662528991699	This is something that has to happen to zero .
H-671	-0.6843124032020569	Every year , we run a big amount of CO2 , more than 26 billion tons .
H-672	-0.5753760933876038	For every American , it &apos;s about 20 tons .
H-673	-0.5299182534217834	For a poor of a poor country , it &apos;s less than a ton .
H-674	-0.37436917424201965	The average is about five tons per person on the planet .
H-675	-0.6709588170051575	And we &apos;ve got to find the way to bring the changes to go down to zero .
H-676	-0.8242619037628174	The increase was constant .
H-677	-0.9242545366287231	It &apos;s because because of various economic changes that it &apos;s slowed down , so we need to spend a quick increase to a decline , until to go down to zero .
H-678	-0.7300160527229309	This equation has four factors .
H-679	-1.3717623949050903	Let &apos;s make a little bit of the power .
H-680	-0.6679561138153076	Now , we have something on the left , CO2 , that we want to reduce zero , and it &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services that every person uses , in average , energy used in average for every service , and the carbon CO2 , by energy unit .
H-681	-0.6883097290992737	So , let &apos;s think about each of these members , and see how we can reduce the result to zero .
H-682	-0.8317404985427856	It &apos;s probably going to be one of these numbers to be close to zero .
H-683	-0.7834168076515198	It &apos;s the level of the secondary albra , but let &apos;s take a look at the eye .
H-684	-0.5854530334472656	First we have the population .
H-685	-0.933933436870575	The world is about 68 billion people .
H-686	-0.9223122596740723	We should get the nine billion .
H-687	-0.9221675395965576	With very good results on the new vaccines , health care , the control control , you could reduce it , maybe 10 or 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to be a factor of increase about 1.3 .
H-688	-0.6968240141868591	The second factor about the services that we use .
H-689	-0.8745215535163879	That &apos;s all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
H-690	-0.6809611916542053	It &apos;s very good things , and get rid of poverty means to provide these services to almost everybody on the planet .
H-691	-0.5902082920074463	And that &apos;s a good thing that this number increases .
H-692	-0.943122148513794	In the rich world , maybe the top of the top , we could probably reduce it , using less , but every year , this number , in average , is going to go up , and end to more than double the number of services by person .
H-693	-1.0286452770233154	Here we &apos;ve got a example of very basic service .
H-694	-1.072396993637085	You &apos;ve got the house to read and do the homework homework . Not these kids . So they come out and do their homework at the light of the street at the street .
H-695	-0.5312959551811218	Now , efficiency , &quot; E , &quot; the amount of energy for every service , and here , we finally have good news .
H-696	-0.7638611793518066	We have something that doesn &apos;t get .
H-697	-0.5036595463752747	Through various inventions and new ways of doing light , through new types of cars , different ways of building buildings .
H-698	-0.8458349108695984	There &apos;s a lot of services that we can reduce the energy in substantial way , and for some particular services , the reduce of 90 percent .
H-699	-1.138645052909851	There &apos;s other services like the way of making the fertilizer , or to do the transport , where the husbands of improvement are a lot more reduce .
H-700	-0.9369163513183594	And so , basically , by being optimistic , we could get a three @-@ factor of three to three to , maybe even , a factor of six .
H-701	-0.7279596328735352	For the first of these first first factors , we &apos;re at the best of 26 billion , maybe 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s not enough .
H-702	-0.5913835167884827	So , let &apos;s see this fourth factor -- that &apos;s going to be a key factor -- and it &apos;s the amount of CO2 @-@ up CO2 .
H-703	-0.4463111460208893	And so , the question is , &quot; Can we reduce it to zero ? &quot;
H-704	-1.0024359226226807	In coal , the answer is not .
H-705	-0.7303256988525391	If you burn the natural gas , no more .
H-706	-0.8952356576919556	Almost all the techniques to produce today , outside renewables and nuclear , rejected CO2 .
H-707	-0.4833289384841919	And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do a global scale , it &apos;s to create a new system .
H-708	-0.9624874591827393	So , we need miracles in the area of energy .
H-709	-0.3087714910507202	But when I use the word miracle , I don &apos;t mean something impossible .
H-710	-0.5245124101638794	The microprocessor is a miracle . The personal computer is a miracle .
H-711	-0.5470129251480103	The Internet and the Web services are a miracle .
H-712	-1.0510212182998657	In this sense , people are here in the creation of many miracles .
H-713	-1.0692729949951172	In the habit , we don &apos;t have a date , where it &apos;s got to do the miracle for a given date .
H-714	-1.14163339138031	And usually , we &apos;re just ready to be ready , and then some of them happen , other not .
H-715	-0.900797963142395	In the case , it &apos;s going to go to all speed and get a miracle with a fairly restricted calendar .
H-716	-0.8579782843589783	I asked me how I could summarize this .
H-717	-0.9743332862854004	Is it a kind of illustration from nature , a demonstration that would have the imagination of people here ?
H-718	-1.0627238750457764	I thought about the last year , when I was brought from mosquitoes , people had well loved .
H-719	-0.6171321272850037	It allowed them to really integrate the idea that there are people who live with mosquitoes .
H-720	-0.7728115320205688	So , with energy , all of what I &apos;ve been able to do is that .
H-721	-0.656528651714325	I decided to release fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here , this year .
H-722	-1.0062626600265503	So here &apos;s here of natural filies .
H-723	-1.0992830991744995	We said that they don &apos;t get , in fact , they could not leave this pot .
H-724	-0.7725673913955688	There &apos;s all sorts of smart solutions like this , but they don &apos;t bring a lot of thing , in fact .
H-725	-0.730593740940094	We need one or many solutions , working with a huge scale , with a huge fiability , and , although we &apos;re looking for a lot of directions , I don &apos;t see that five who are holding the road .
H-726	-1.305253505706787	I &apos;ve left the side of the marent energy , geothery , fusion , biofuels .
H-727	-0.8227980732917786	They bring their contribution , and if it &apos;s more that I don &apos;t think , much better , but my idea there , it &apos;s that on these five @-@ up , there &apos;s still working to do , and we can &apos;t leave it , even if it looks difficult , even if the challenges to look very important .
H-728	-0.7787992358207703	Let &apos;s look at all the fossil fuels , that it &apos;s about coal or natural gas .
H-729	-1.1325188875198364	And what it &apos;s going to do there is simple , but it &apos;s not , it &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after it &apos;s going to get out of the circuit , and it &apos;s going to get it .
H-730	-0.8482765555381775	There &apos;s advanced projects to realize that to 60 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be 100 percent , it &apos;s going to be very delicate , and it &apos;s going to be hard to come from the place where all this CO2 should be put , but the most hard is here the question of the long term .
H-731	-0.9186425805091858	Who &apos;s going to have this certainty ?
H-732	-0.8102935552597046	Who can guarantee something that &apos;s billions of times more flying than any other kind of waste that you can think about , nuclear or other ?
H-733	-0.5853164792060852	It &apos;s a lot of volume .
H-734	-0.5496901869773865	So it &apos;s going to be difficult for this solution .
H-735	-0.5051482319831848	And then there &apos;s nuclear .
H-736	-1.3436126708984375	It &apos;s also going to be three big problems .
H-737	-0.9971969127655029	The cost , in particular in the highly regulated countries , is high .
H-738	-0.7227196097373962	The question of security , to be really sure that there &apos;s no problem , that even by having human operators , the fuel doesn &apos;t use for weapons .
H-739	-0.7398404479026794	And then , what do you do with the waste ?
H-740	-0.9596901535987854	And , although the volume doesn &apos;t be a lot , it &apos;s a lot of problems .
H-741	-1.1350222826004028	People need to feel good there .
H-742	-0.7586596608161926	So , three very difficult problems that could be solved , and so , on which it would have to work .
H-743	-0.9314689636230469	The last three of the five , I put them together .
H-744	-0.9928874969482422	They &apos;re the ones that people do often reference as renewable energy .
H-745	-0.9216699600219727	But in fact , even if it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need any fuel -- they &apos;re going to have a couple of downents .
H-746	-1.1698484420776367	The first is that the density of energy produced because of these technologies is very lower to the power of a power power .
H-747	-0.671132504940033	It &apos;s about energy farms , we &apos;re talking about many miles , thousands of times more space than a normal energy power .
H-748	-2.1656548976898193	In addition to these are functional sources by intermittm .
H-749	-0.8255625367164612	The sun doesn &apos;t get all the day , it doesn &apos;t get every day , and , like the ilament , the wind doesn &apos;t breath all the time .
H-750	-0.7243853211402893	And so , if you go to these sources , you &apos;ve got to have a way to get energy for these periods of time that it &apos;s not available .
H-751	-0.9645947813987732	We &apos;ve got a big amount of costs .
H-752	-1.2037584781646729	We &apos;ve got transmission problems .
H-753	-0.7520570755004883	For example , let &apos;s say that energy source is outside your country , so not only you need technology , but you have to face the risk of a energy came from the way .
H-754	-0.6318886876106262	And finally , there &apos;s this problem of storage .
H-755	-0.8736777901649475	So , to make this , I &apos;ve studied all the kinds of batteries we make , for cars , for computers , the phones , the flashlights , for all , and compared to the amount of power energy used in the world , and what I &apos;ve seen , is that the whole of the batteries that we &apos;re doing today could store less than 10 minutes of the energy .
H-756	-0.7544787526130676	So , in fact , we need a major breakthrough here , something that can improve a factor of 100 of the approaches that we have now .
H-757	-0.2833554446697235	It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
H-758	-0.765758752822876	That &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at when you &apos;re trying to get to get more , let &apos;s say , 20 to 30 percent of what we use .
H-759	-0.9610004425048828	If you account on this source to provide the 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
H-760	-0.6662036180496216	Now , let &apos;s try to move on the question of the good approach to adopt .
H-761	-0.8710983991622925	Is it a new &quot; Project Manhattan &quot; ? What means to happen ?
H-762	-0.6629818677902222	Well , we need a big number of companies to work on the subject , hundreds .
H-763	-0.6677332520484924	In each of these five lanes , we need at least a hundred people .
H-764	-0.3610480725765228	And for many of them , you &apos;ll think they &apos;re crazy . It &apos;s perfect .
H-765	-1.0482121706008911	And , I think here , in the TED group , a lot of people are already going on these lanes .
H-766	-1.547098159790039	Bill Gross has a lot of societies , which one called a called called a couple of different technologies .
H-767	-1.1433743238449097	And that od Khosla in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I try to help to support these projects .
H-768	-1.1645761728286743	In fact , Nathan Myhrvold and me , we &apos;re going to support a company that , it will be wondering maybe , has chosen the nuclear approach .
H-769	-0.78232342004776	There are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
H-770	-1.0355170965194702	And the innovation really had been done in this industry for a while , so , the idea that there &apos;s a few good ideas that &apos;s not surprising .
H-771	-0.3975052535533905	The idea of Terrapower is , instead of burning a part of uranium , this one percent , which is the U235 , we decided to burn the other 99 percent , the U238 .
H-772	-0.5665233731269836	It &apos;s a little bit crazy idea .
H-773	-0.9289634227752686	In fact , it was a long time that people in talking , but they &apos;d never get to simulate properly if it would work or not , then it &apos;s because of the great @-@ computer @-@ computers that we could do the simulation , and see that , yes , with the right approach of materials , it seems that it can walk .
H-774	-0.8291301727294922	And , because you &apos;re burning these 99 percent , you &apos;ve got a lot to make the cost of costs .
H-775	-0.9525126814842224	What you &apos;re burning , they &apos;re the waste , and you can use as fuel the waste of waste waste by the reactors today .
H-776	-0.6691336035728455	So instead of worrying about them , we use them . It &apos;s something .
H-777	-0.8854577541351318	It &apos;s going to do this uranium in functional . It &apos;s a little bit like a candle .
H-778	-1.3265933990478516	You can see that as a bp , we &apos;ve often talked about &quot; actor &apos;s reactor . &quot;
H-779	-0.517370343208313	In terms of fuel , it really solves the problem .
H-780	-0.5728552341461182	I have a picture here in Kentucky .
H-781	-0.9674293398857117	They &apos;re the &quot; remains &quot; &quot; The 99 percent , which we &apos;ve taken all the part we &apos;re doing now , then we call that &quot; uranium &apos; uranium .
H-782	-0.6647788882255554	It would allow the United States for hundreds of years .
H-783	-0.9714704751968384	And , by a little bit expensive , just by filing the water water , you &apos;d have enough fuel for all the life of the rest of the planet .
H-784	-0.55511075258255	Okay , there &apos;s still a lot of way to do , but it &apos;s an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move .
H-785	-0.9531890749931335	Let &apos;s think , how are we going to make our form of notation ?
H-786	-1.0887930393218994	What should we look like our road sheet ?
H-787	-0.772254228591919	Let &apos;s start with the goal that we have to reach , and then let &apos;s look at the intermediate steps .
H-788	-0.33353671431541443	For 2050 , you &apos;ve heard a lot of people talking about this 80 percent reduction .
H-789	-0.836799144744873	It &apos;s really very important that we &apos;re going to get .
H-790	-0.5943620800971985	And the 20 percent comes from what &apos;s going on in the poor countries , or a little bit of agriculture .
H-791	-1.5826778411865234	Now , let &apos;s take that here we &apos;re going to have a foresviculture and a industry of clean it .
H-792	-0.832025408744812	So , to get to these 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have to turn completely their methods of electricity production .
H-793	-0.901587724685669	The next level , it &apos;s going to put up this zero @-@ show technology , to put it into all the developed countries and being going to do it in the other countries .
H-794	-0.6149762272834778	It &apos;s great .
H-795	-0.867202639579773	It &apos;s a essential element to hold the road sheet .
H-796	-1.1657754182815552	So , back back from there , what &apos;s what &apos;s looking like the sheet of 2020 ?
H-797	-0.6241639852523804	Well , again , we should have the two elements .
H-798	-1.6263494491577148	We &apos;ve got to spend by efficiency of efficiency to start to get some of the people .
H-799	-0.9273636341094971	Less than us , less big will be the sum of CO2 , and therefore , less hot will be the temperature .
H-800	-1.2243430614471436	But in some ways , the level that we &apos;re going to do here , by doing things that don &apos;t get all of the important @-@ to @-@ important , is not more important , and maybe even less , that this other , which is the innovation on which we &apos;re going to do these breakthrough .
H-801	-1.3567016124725342	And these progress , we need to realize them at all speed , and we can quantify that in terms of societies , of piloting projects , and it &apos;s a lot of pilotions .
H-802	-0.7270206809043884	A lot of great books have been written about this .
H-803	-0.9208150506019592	The Al Gore &apos;s book , &quot; Our Choix &quot; and the book of David McKay , &quot; It &apos;s the sustainable @-@ hot sustainable energy . &quot;
H-804	-1.0840365886688232	They &apos;re really looking at the subject , and create a framework that opens out to the discussion , because we need a large support for this .
H-805	-0.8069872856140137	A lot of things have to happen in the same time .
H-806	-0.38921162486076355	So it &apos;s a wish .
H-807	-0.8222845792770386	It &apos;s a very concrete wish , that we &apos;re making this technology .
H-808	-0.8889586329460144	If we gave one one wish to do for the next 50 years , if I could choose the next President , or choose a vaccine , which is something I like , or even choose that this thing was invented , a cost of a two without no CO2 show , it &apos;s this last I would choose .
H-809	-0.7429330348968506	That &apos;s the one that would have the largest impact .
H-810	-0.49033021926879883	If this wish doesn &apos;t realize , the division between people who think about short term and long term will be terrible , between the United States and China , between poor countries and rich countries , and life will be worse for most of these two billion people .
H-811	-0.6040887236595154	So what do we do ?
H-812	-0.6378384232521057	What do I call you to go to the before ?
H-813	-0.8350031971931458	You need more funding for research .
H-814	-0.6246169805526733	When the countries come together , like Copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t talk about CO2 .
H-815	-1.1819192171096802	They should talk about this innovation program , and you &apos;d be surprised by the level of low @-@ lethal spending spending by these innovative approaches .
H-816	-1.1837559938430786	We need incentives for the market , a CO2 @-@ to @-@ the @-@ offs and exchange , something that activates a price signal .
H-817	-0.8873128294944763	We &apos;ve got to make the message .
H-818	-0.5307037830352783	We need this dialogue to become more rational , more understandable , including the steps , the measurements that the government takes .
H-819	-0.42084628343582153	It &apos;s a important wish , but I think we can do it .
H-820	-0.11344344168901443	Thank you .
H-821	-0.11344344168901443	Thank you .
H-822	-0.27842867374420166	I thank you . Thank you .
H-823	-0.8128471970558167	Thank you . Just to better understand , about Terrapower , I mean , first of all , can you give a idea of the investments of investments that this represents ?
H-824	-1.0252180099487305	To end the software with the supercalculator , hire the best scientists , what we &apos;ve done , it &apos;s only just in tens of millions of millions , and even by having our material in a Russian reactor to make sure they &apos;re working properly , we &apos;re only in the hundreds of millions of million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million millions
H-825	-0.9820076823234558	The most hard is the building building building , find the few billion , find the regulator , the location is how we will build the first .
H-826	-0.946556031703949	Once the first will be built , if it works like announced , then it &apos;s going to be an evidence , with economic data and density of energy , so different of the nuclear people we know .
H-827	-0.9490259885787964	So , to understand , it involves to build , deep in the ground , something like a kind of nuclear fuel @-@ fuel column , made this uranium , and then the process starts by the top and continue to the bottom ?
H-828	-1.3393608331680298	That &apos;s this . Today , we have to have constantly ravited the fuel reactor , so it requires a lot of people and a lot of control can be wrong , as you have to open it up , and get it up and get things .
H-829	-0.34897318482398987	It &apos;s not good .
H-830	-1.1350884437561035	But if we &apos;ve got a very cheap fuel that we can put for 60 years -- just just like a bake -- the ask there without all these same complex problems .
H-831	-0.5729454159736633	It &apos;s there , he &apos;s going to burn for 60 years and then it &apos;s finished .
H-832	-0.6471591591835022	It &apos;s a nuclear power that &apos;s its own solution of elimination .
H-833	-0.7733574509620667	Yeah . Well , what &apos;s going on with the waste , it &apos;s that you can leave them in place -- there &apos;s a lot of waste with this approach -- and then you can get them , put them into another reactor and burn everything .
H-834	-1.3853787183761597	In fact , we start with the waste that exist today , which are in these cooling @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ time .
H-835	-0.8481113910675049	That &apos;s the fuel that we start with .
H-836	-0.9415318369865417	What &apos;s been a problem with the old reactors , that &apos;s what feeds our own , and we &apos;re reduced the volume of the waste with this process .
H-837	-0.9068795442581177	But when you &apos;re talking about people around you , in the entire world , the possibilities we have here , where are you the most interest to actually do something ?
H-838	-0.8856102824211121	Well , we haven &apos;t chosen particular place , and there &apos;s all these rules of diegation about everything that &apos;s going to be in nuclear , so , so we &apos;re so a lot of interest , and the society sent people in Russia , India , China .
H-839	-1.1359245777130127	I &apos;m back to see the Secretary of Secretary here , talking about how it is in the energy agenda .
H-840	-0.7140153646469116	I &apos;m optimistic . You know the French and the Japanese did the good work .
H-841	-0.7905420660972595	It &apos;s a diverse variant of something that &apos;s already been done .
H-842	-0.772009015083313	It &apos;s an important progress , but it &apos;s like a quick refast , and many countries already have built , so each of those are candidate to be the first country where we build the first .
H-843	-1.3669179677963257	What &apos;s , according to you , the way and the probability of getting this right in reality ?
H-844	-0.8133907914161682	Well , for one of these @-@ scale @-@ scale power , and it &apos;s only a approximation , we have to count 20 year to invent , and 20 years to work in work .
H-845	-1.1679885387420654	It &apos;s like the kind of environmental models that the environmental models have shown us that he had to wait .
H-846	-0.8188408017158508	And , you know , Terrapower , if things &apos;s going to be good , what &apos;s a lot of hope , could easily hold these time .
H-847	-1.1226520538330078	And there &apos;s fortunately , today , tens of companies , and it &apos;s got to have hundreds of them , which will be , if the scientific side of the world &apos;s funding is happening , also in the competition .
H-848	-0.8141489028930664	And it &apos;s going to be better if we &apos;re doing a lot of success , because we &apos;re going to use a mixture of this .
H-849	-1.0836232900619507	It &apos;s got to have one of these kinds of projects .
H-850	-0.7407534122467041	In terms of the rules of the high @-@ scale game , is that the most important thing you &apos;ve heard about ?
H-851	-0.8444887399673462	A breakthrough in the area of energy is the most important thing .
H-852	-1.0938276052474976	It would have been , even without the constrte of the environment , but the environmental constrte makes it just so much more important .
H-853	-0.6277201771736145	In the nuclear field , there are other innovators .
H-854	-0.6720210313796997	You know , we don &apos;t also know their work that this , but there &apos;s those who study the approach by modules , it &apos;s a different approach .
H-855	-0.7901816964149475	There &apos;s the liquid type of type , which seems a little bit difficult , but it &apos;s perhaps what they also thought of us .
H-857	-0.583437442779541	And if it doesn &apos;t work , what do you do ?
H-858	-1.0816634893417358	Should we start to take the urgency of urgency to try to keep the temperature of the land ?
H-859	-0.9070643782615662	If you came to this situation , it would be like if you had too eaten , and you &apos;d be ready to have an arctus .
H-860	-0.5939052104949951	So , where do you go ? You need heart surgery or something like that .
H-861	-1.0662992000579834	There &apos;s a research line on what &apos;s called geo @-@ engineering , wearing different technical techniques , which was going to get the warming , to win the 20 or 30 years necessary to take us in hand .
H-862	-0.5400390028953552	It &apos;s nothing more than a insurance police .
H-863	-0.7143341302871704	We don &apos;t need to need it .
H-864	-0.7716678380966187	Some people say it doesn &apos;t even have to work in this direction , because it could make us lazy , as if you &apos;re going to get to eat because you know that heart surgery will be there to save you .
H-865	-0.8986503481864929	I &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s turned out , given the problem of the problem , but , good , there &apos;s this story of geo @-@ engineering story , to keep the bottom of the pocket , in case things are getting more faster than , or that innovation is much more slow .
H-866	-0.7436717748641968	The &quot; skeptical @-@ skeptical : if you had one or two sentences to tell them , how could you persuade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
H-867	-0.4367102086544037	Well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in different camps .
H-868	-1.3006547689437866	The ones that the arguments are scientists are very many .
H-869	-1.1550686359405518	Are they that there are negative feedback effects that have to see with the clouds that have thought about things ?
H-870	-0.5679311156272888	There &apos;s very , very few things that they can even say , there &apos;s a chance about a million to this .
H-871	-0.5948098301887512	The main problem we have here is a little bit like with AIDS .
H-872	-0.60116046667099	You &apos;re doing a mistake now , and you pay the price a lot later .
H-873	-1.3420292139053345	When you don &apos;t have any kind of urgent problem , this idea of self @-@ to @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ to @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ to @-@ the @-@ hand .
H-874	-0.8810190558433533	In fact , the report of the Intergovernment Intergovernment @-@ to @-@ the @-@ axis of Climate , it &apos;s not necessarily the worst of the case , and there are people in the rich countries that look at the GIEC and say , &quot; Okay , it &apos;s not so important . &quot;
H-875	-0.7334330081939697	The fact is that it &apos;s this part of uncertainty that should grow us in this direction .
H-876	-0.7976216673851013	But my dream is that , if you can do that it &apos;s economic , and respond to CO2 constraints , then the skeptics will say , &quot; OK , it &apos;s not just the CO2 , I &apos;d have a question that it &apos;s moved from CO2 , but I think I &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s better market than those before .
H-877	-0.7233721613883972	And then , it would be your answer to the argument of Bjorn Lombs , that if we spend all this energy to try to solve the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to take all the other goals , like trying to get the world of poverty and malaria , etc , etc , so it &apos;s a stupid waste of the resources to spend money for this , when there &apos;s much better to do .
H-878	-0.9228712916374207	Well , the really dedicated spending in the National &amp; amp -- say , if the United States thought 10 billion more than a year -- it wouldn &apos;t be so dramatic .
H-879	-1.3645981550216675	It doesn &apos;t make the other percent of spending in because .
H-880	-0.8055360317230225	And where people &apos;s people can &apos;t agree , and you &apos;re talking here big are , it &apos;s when you have something not economic , and you try to fund it .
H-881	-0.7225028276443481	It &apos;s mostly that , for me , which is waste .
H-882	-0.5246636271476746	Except if we &apos;re very close to the solution , and what we finance is the progression of knowledge , and that &apos;s going to be very good market .
H-883	-0.7890040874481201	I think we should try to try more things that might , potentially , cost a lot less expensive .
H-884	-1.1566801071166992	If the arbitrary that you &apos;re shocking is &quot; Rendons the superexpensive energy , &quot; then the rich is going to allow it .
H-885	-0.6639746427536011	What I mean is that we all have , here , we could allow us to pay our energy five times more expensive , without changing our lifestyle .
H-886	-0.6372314095497131	The disaster would be for these two billion people .
H-887	-1.2111870050430298	And even Lombal has changed .
H-888	-0.7684148550033569	This thing , now , that &apos;s repeat , &quot; why don &apos;t we talk about R &amp; amp . &quot;
H-889	-0.9891528487205505	It &apos;s still , because of the deal of before , always associated with the camp camp camp , but he figured out that it &apos;s a pretty solitarian position , then he brings his thing of R &amp; D .
H-890	-0.5214901566505432	But in there , there &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t seem to be wrong .
H-891	-1.003371238708496	It &apos;s crazy to see how the R &amp; D is a little bit funding .
H-892	-0.5859394073486328	Well , Bill , I think I &apos;m talking about the name of most people here saying that I really hope your wish to be reality . Thank you very much .
H-893	-0.584507167339325	I thank you . I &apos;ve known many fish in my life .
H-894	-0.7247241139411926	There &apos;s only two that I loved .
H-895	-0.8945279121398926	With the first , it was kind of a passionate relationship .
H-896	-1.783090591430664	It was a beautiful fish , savous , text @-@ shaped , charter @-@ selling @-@ selling @-@ selling .
H-897	-2.0637736320495605	What fish !
H-898	-0.9056870341300964	But again , he was supposed to be raised by the most high standards of sustainability .
H-899	-1.385858416557312	What &apos;s doing by the selling , you &apos;ve felt good .
H-900	-0.6077532768249512	I &apos;ve been in relationship with this beauty for several months .
H-901	-1.1257113218307495	One day , the boss &apos;s boss called me and asked me if I wanted to take the word to a conference on the sustainable aspect of his own .
H-902	-1.6934154033660889	It &apos;s just Absolutely , I said .
H-903	-0.7813717722892761	We had a company that was trying to solve what &apos;s become a unimaginable problem for our leaders .
H-904	-0.8360569477081299	How do you keep the fish on our menus ?
H-905	-1.0892376899719238	Over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fish in the seas , as we &apos;ve got the forests of the forests .
H-906	-0.5114568471908569	It &apos;s hard to exaggerate destruction .
H-907	-1.2538799047470093	90 percent of the big fish , the ones we like , the tunas , the flan , the salmon , the hoped , have seen their stores to collapse .
H-908	-0.7202833890914917	There &apos;s no more nothing .
H-909	-0.9468050599098206	So , for the best or for the worst , the aquatic aquture , the fish of fish , will be part of our future .
H-910	-0.5385278463363647	There &apos;s a lot of arguments against this practice .
H-911	-1.0076844692230225	The farms of polluted aquture , at least most of them , and they &apos;re ineffective , take for example of tuna .
H-912	-1.05953848361969	A major failure .
H-913	-1.0020703077316284	He &apos;s got a food @-@ to @-@ a @-@ one @-@ to @-@ a @-@ one @-@ one ratio .
H-914	-1.2748531103134155	It means that it &apos;s going to take a 15 @-@ pound fish to get a kilo of corting tuna .
H-915	-0.6551647782325745	Not very sustainable .
H-916	-1.1873774528503418	Not very good taste .
H-917	-0.8888325691223145	So here &apos;s , finally , a company that &apos;s trying to do the things .
H-918	-0.5313870310783386	I wanted to support them .
H-919	-0.9092724919319153	The day of the event , I called the director of the public relationships of the company .
H-920	-1.0821120738983154	Let &apos;s go back to him .
H-921	-1.2239322662353516	And then Don &apos;t say , I said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re very excited to raise your fish if far in sea , that you don &apos;t pollut .
H-922	-1.0234774351119995	And so it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true . We &apos;ve been installed so far , that the waste of our fish are dispersed , not focused .
H-923	-0.7775056958198547	And then he &apos;s added : We &apos;re basically a autonomous world .
H-924	-1.3349283933639526	The food @-@ to @-@ the @-@ food @-@ to @-@ a @-@ one @-@ t @-@ up ,
H-925	-1.0607043504714966	It &apos;s the best in business .
H-926	-1.5889019966125488	Two for one , not bad .
H-927	-1.8452200889587402	Now , about the one of them ? You &apos;re getting them out of what ?
H-928	-1.4530982971191406	It &apos;s going to be sustainable proteins .
H-929	-1.203669548034668	I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; I &apos;ve raced the phone .
H-930	-0.790533721446991	And this night , I was in my bed , and I thought , &quot; Well , what does it be , a sustainable protein ?
H-931	-0.5591392517089844	So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
H-932	-0.6271369457244873	I said , &quot; Don &apos;t you give me some examples of sustainable proteins ?
H-933	-0.6424686312675476	He said he didn &apos;t know . He &apos;s going to ask it around him .
H-934	-0.7572587132453918	So , I had some people from the company in the phone .
H-935	-0.5405824780464172	No one could give me a clear answer .
H-936	-1.2445991039276123	Until finally , I &apos;ve got to the phone &apos;s phone in the head .
H-937	-1.0155445337295532	Let &apos;s call it again .
H-938	-1.1188284158706665	And I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;m going to give me a few examples of sustainable proteins ?
H-939	-1.1607297658920288	Well , he mentioned some algae and some fish for fish , and then he said of chicken @-@ chicken .
H-940	-1.1914163827896118	I said , &quot; Well , what &apos;s the chicken of chicken ?
H-941	-1.4274548292160034	He said , &quot; Yeah , the feathers , the skin , the bone of bone , the remains , the remains and transformed in food for animals .
H-942	-0.727618932723999	I said , &quot; What &apos;s the percentage of chicken in food ?
H-943	-0.6230385303497314	I thought , you see , at something like two percent .
H-944	-1.0611873865127563	Well , about 30 percent , has he said .
H-945	-1.0051378011703491	I asked him , &quot; Oh , what &apos;s sustainable to feed fish with chicken ?
H-946	-0.6468573808670044	There &apos;s a long silence online , and he said , &quot; It &apos;s just there &apos;s too many chickens in the world .
H-947	-0.8246394395828247	My love for this fish turned out .
H-948	-1.2267789840698242	No , it &apos;s not because I &apos;m a untransited food of food and hot food .
H-949	-0.6904087662696838	What I &apos;m actually , in fact .
H-950	-0.6660619974136353	No , my love for this fish turned out because , I swear it back to God , after this conversation , the fish had a chicken taste .
H-951	-0.4731042683124542	The second fish , it &apos;s another kind of love history .
H-952	-0.8311437964439392	It &apos;s the kind of romantic , the kind of kind of you learn to know your fish , the more you love the fish .
H-953	-0.6597321629524231	I first ate in a restaurant in the south of Spain .
H-954	-0.6910786032676697	A friend was talking about this fish for a long time .
H-955	-1.3666454553604126	It &apos;s kind of made a art .
H-956	-1.104841709136963	It &apos;s happened on the table with a bright white color , almost kitoying .
H-957	-2.1007802486419678	The chief had too spoled .
H-958	-0.5808480978012085	Something like two times too long .
H-959	-1.1817282438278198	It was always delicious .
H-960	-1.942308783531189	Who can make a fish to be good taste after it was too well ?
H-961	-0.8031904697418213	Not me , but this guy happened .
H-962	-1.2560575008392334	Let &apos;s call the Migburg .
H-963	-1.1381169557571411	In fact it &apos;s called Migburg .
H-964	-0.5502353310585022	And no , he didn &apos;t have the fish , and it wasn &apos;t a chef .
H-965	-1.067268967628479	It doesn &apos;t have the sense where you and I hear it .
H-966	-0.779853105545044	It &apos;s a Veta &apos;s biologist .
H-967	-0.6557323336601257	It &apos;s a fish of fish in the West of Spain .
H-968	-1.3216632604599	It &apos;s at the river of the Guadalasvir river .
H-969	-0.856391191482544	Until the 1980s , the farm was the hands of Argentds .
H-970	-2.264354944229126	They &apos;d raise a drink of candle on what was essentially the swills .
H-971	-1.2893593311309814	They &apos;ve done it in order to make the land .
H-972	-0.6254743933677673	They built this complex series of channels , they &apos;ve got the water water and sent it into the river .
H-973	-0.5797501802444458	Finally , it doesn &apos;t work , economically .
H-974	-0.9743981957435608	And ecologically , it was a disaster .
H-975	-0.5720639228820801	It killed near 90 percent of the birds , which , for the place , represents a lot of birds .
H-976	-1.0295578241348267	And in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental consciousness has to bought the ground .
H-977	-0.33905550837516785	What did they do ?
H-978	-1.0477991104125977	They &apos;ve got the flow of water .
H-979	-1.1446093320846558	They literally pulled up the switch .
H-980	-0.8088444471359253	Instead of extract water , they used the channels to bring water .
H-981	-1.0317506790161133	They &apos;ve flooted the channels .
H-982	-1.3015333414077759	They &apos;ve created a farm farm of 110 miles square square square square , mulet , shrimp and in this process , Miguel and this company have completely inapped the ecological destruction .
H-983	-1.0435783863067627	The farm is incredible .
H-984	-0.5527538061141968	I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
H-985	-1.0950313806533813	You ask the eyes on a horizon that &apos;s about millions of miles , and everything you see , these are chemical channels and this thick and rich land of mard .
H-986	-1.1550288200378418	I was there there &apos;s a little time with Migburg .
H-987	-1.0137046575546265	It &apos;s a amazing guy , three @-@ quarters of Charles Darwin and a quarter of Crocodile Dundee .
H-988	-1.070154070854187	OK ? Now , we &apos;re walking to work in humor , and I &apos;m haleting and sub , mud up to the lap , and Miguel gives a lesson of biology .
H-989	-1.033988118171692	It &apos;s a white @-@ white rare .
H-990	-1.038964867591858	And then , he &apos;s talking about about phytoplankton .
H-991	-1.3694672584533691	And here , here , there &apos;s seeing a model of a group that reminds him the Tanzania giraffe .
H-992	-0.8307060599327087	It turns out that Miguel has spent the largest part of his career in the National Mikumi in Africa .
H-993	-0.77248615026474	I asked him how he became a expert in fish .
H-994	-0.8484997749328613	He said , &quot; Well , fish ? I didn &apos;t know anything .
H-995	-0.6339768171310425	I &apos;m an expert in relationships .
H-996	-0.9481041431427002	And then it &apos;s moving in his conversation about rare birds and algae and weird plants .
H-997	-1.0061869621276855	And you don &apos;t try , it was really fascinating , you know , something like the biobiotic community community .
H-998	-0.5105130672454834	It was great , but I was love .
H-999	-1.4577780961990356	And I &apos;m going to me , but even to remember that this little piece of delicious delicious that I had the night night .
H-1000	-0.9408681392669678	So I &apos;ve interrupted it . I said , &quot; Well , what &apos;s what &apos;s so good taste to your fish ?
H-1001	-0.7295585870742798	He showed me the algae .
H-1002	-0.7316933870315552	I know , guy , algae , phytoplankton , relationships , it &apos;s great --
H-1003	-0.6889699101448059	But what are eating your fish ?
H-1004	-0.7846556901931763	What &apos;s the food @-@ food ratio ?
H-1005	-0.8760343194007874	Now , it &apos;s still going to explain this is a so rich system , that the fish eat what they &apos;re eating in nature .
H-1006	-0.7401926517486572	The biomass of plants , phytoplankton , zooplankton , that &apos;s what feeds the fish .
H-1007	-0.9489322304725647	The system is so healthy , that it &apos;s self @-@ minded itself .
H-1008	-0.8444887399673462	We don &apos;t feed them .
H-1009	-0.5778188109397888	Have you already heard about a farm that doesn &apos;t feed his animals ?
H-1010	-1.0459595918655396	And then later this day , I was doing a turn on property property with Miguel , and I asked him , I &apos;ve asked it , to be a place that seems so natural , unlike all the farms that I &apos;d ever seen , how do you measure the success ?
H-1011	-1.4419711828231812	At this point , it was like a stage in the stage had suddenly changed the gold .
H-1012	-1.099717617034912	We &apos;ve taken a point , and there &apos;s seen a absolutely amazing show , thousands and thousands of flamers , a real pink carpet , if it &apos;s going to spread as far as the view .
H-1013	-1.0388492345809937	And that &apos;s the success , he said .
H-1014	-0.8950504064559937	They look at their venters , &#91; all &#93; pink .
H-1015	-1.1801598072052002	They &apos;re a festoe .
H-1016	-1.3825031518936157	Sfesh ? I was completely lost .
H-1017	-1.0177847146987915	I said , &quot; Well , what &apos;s what they wouldn &apos;t be able to restand with your fish ? &quot;
H-1018	-1.1869195699691772	And yeah , he said , &quot;
H-1019	-0.9072495698928833	It &apos;s losing 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs because of birds .
H-1020	-0.7646756172180176	Well , last year , on this property there was 600 birds , more than 250 different species .
H-1021	-1.0808568000793457	It &apos;s become , today , the biggest and one of the most important of the private birds of Europe .
H-1022	-1.3284002542495728	I said , &quot; Oh Miguel , a population of birds in the middle @-@ up birds isn &apos;t it the last thing we want to be on a fish of fish ?
H-1023	-1.6016138792037964	He &apos;s got the head , and it &apos;s all .
H-1024	-1.336374282836914	He said , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got a trained @-@ up , not intensive .
H-1025	-0.5018026232719421	It &apos;s a ecological network .
H-1026	-1.348517894744873	The flamers are eating the shrimp .
H-1027	-0.9437538981437683	The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
H-1028	-1.1224688291549683	So more the belly is pink , better is the system .
H-1029	-0.8468544483184814	OK , now let .
H-1030	-0.669707715511322	A farm that doesn &apos;t feed his animals , is a farm that measures its success to the health of her predators .
H-1031	-1.425806999206543	A farm farm , but also a bird of birds .
H-1032	-0.6797519326210022	Oh , and in the way , these flamers , first , they don &apos;t even be there .
H-1033	-1.1888370513916016	They &apos;ve got a city to 250 miles from there , where the ground is more prosive to build their nids .
H-1034	-0.7072829008102417	Every morning , they fly on 250 miles to get to the farm .
H-1035	-0.7830603718757629	And every night , they &apos;re doing 250 miles for the back .
H-1036	-0.7178041934967041	They &apos;re doing this because they &apos;re coming to follow the white line of the A92 .
H-1037	-1.5760446786880493	Without a joke .
H-1038	-1.201481580734253	I was thinking about a thing in the kind of the penguins &apos;s work , then I looked at Miguel .
H-1039	-0.8782010078430176	I said , &quot; Oh Miguel , they really do 250 miles to come to the farm , and the night , they &apos;re doing 250 miles in the other sense ?
H-1040	-1.005892276763916	Do they do that for small ?
H-1041	-0.9596074819564819	He looked at me as if I was a song of Whitney Houston .
H-1042	-0.46185338497161865	He said , &quot; No , they do it because food is better . &quot;
H-1043	-0.46850305795669556	I didn &apos;t talk about the skin of my fish @-@ loved fish , which was delicious , and I don &apos;t like fish skin .
H-1044	-0.5615646243095398	I don &apos;t like it . I don &apos;t like it . I don &apos;t like it .
H-1045	-0.8591150641441345	It &apos;s so much , it &apos;s the tar soap .
H-1046	-1.0846202373504639	I &apos;m not going to keep it in the kitchen .
H-1047	-0.9832963347434998	Yet , when I tasted it in this restaurant of the Spain of Spain , she didn &apos;t have the whole fish of fish skin .
H-1048	-1.2403842210769653	She had a sweet and clean taste like if you &apos;re going to get a candle of the ocean .
H-1049	-1.46851646900177	I said that to Migs , and he &apos;s got a lot of it .
H-1050	-0.8058446645736694	He said , the skin is like a sponge .
H-1051	-0.7270395159721375	It &apos;s the last part of defense before something doesn &apos;t get in the organism .
H-1052	-1.6946922540664673	It &apos;s been evolved to absorb the ununable .
H-1053	-1.2305924892425537	And then he &apos;s added : But our water doesn &apos;t have ununreled . &quot;
H-1054	-0.642845630645752	OK . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish .
H-1055	-0.9517104625701904	A farm that measures its success by the success of his predators .
H-1056	-1.2544125318527222	And then I figured out that when he said that when he said a farm that didn &apos;t have ununted , it &apos;s a sacred sacred , because the water that flows in this exploitation comes from the Guadalasvir river .
H-1057	-0.8838769793510437	It &apos;s the river that carries with her all the things that rivers tend to wear our days , contaminated contaminated , ruins of pesticides .
H-1058	-1.0368101596832275	And when she &apos;s doing its path through the system and rehand , the water is more clean than when she &apos;s entrance .
H-1059	-0.8416034579277039	The system is so healthy that it &apos;s spreading water .
H-1060	-0.7189401984214783	So not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed his animals , not only a farm that measures its success to the health of her predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water factory of water , and not only for these fish , but for you and also .
H-1061	-1.0332767963409424	Because when the water comes out , it &apos;s coming up in the Atlantic .
H-1062	-0.6385681629180908	A drop in the ocean , I know well , but I &apos;m going to take it , and you &apos;m going to do it , because this story of love , even if she &apos;s romantic , is also instructive .
H-1063	-0.7853614091873169	You might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of the right food , that you &apos;re talking about bars , or bands of candle .
H-1064	-0.9653082489967346	What we need now is a radically new design of agriculture , in which food is really good .
H-1065	-0.7404204607009888	But for a lot of people that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
H-1066	-1.2361422777175903	We &apos;re not realized , we &apos;re others , we &apos;ve got a lot of gastronomy .
H-1067	-1.335587978363037	We &apos;re a couple of people .
H-1068	-1.3713465929031372	We &apos;ll love the markets of producers .
H-1069	-1.563354253768921	We love the little family of family .
H-1070	-0.7940868735313416	We &apos;re talking about local food .
H-1071	-1.1562985181808472	We eat organic .
H-1072	-0.8857213258743286	And when you suggest that it &apos;s all that will make the future of the right food , someone , somewhere , gets up and says , &quot; Hey , I love the flamers , but how do you do to feed the world ?
H-1073	-0.6024689078330994	How do you go to feed the world ?
H-1074	-0.8065651059150696	Can I be honest ?
H-1075	-0.3554869592189789	I don &apos;t like that question .
H-1076	-0.4632799029350281	No , it &apos;s not because we &apos;re producing more than enough calories to feed the world .
H-1077	-0.6105754375457764	One billion people are hungry today .
H-1078	-1.2374430894851685	One billion -- more than ever before -- because of the quality of quality in the distribution , and not the thage .
H-1079	-0.7108047604560852	I don &apos;t like that question because u she determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years .
H-1080	-1.371748447418213	Sacal grain for herbivores , pesticides for the monocultures , chemicals for the soil , chicken for the fish , and all of the long , the agro is just asked : If we feed more world for less expensive , is that so serious ?
H-1081	-0.7699960470199585	It &apos;s been our motivation . It &apos;s been the justification . It &apos;s been the predictable plan of American agriculture .
H-1082	-1.2498496770858765	It &apos;s got to look at things in front of it . It &apos;s a sector @-@ by @-@ up activity , a activity that &apos;s going to get quickly fast the ecological capital that makes its own possible production .
H-1083	-0.4766892194747925	It &apos;s not a company , or agriculture .
H-1084	-0.997698187828064	Our bread to bread is threatened today , not because of the supply of the offer , but because of the scarness of resources ,
H-1085	-1.0203146934509277	not by the last inventions for giving them new and tractors , but because of the land land , not by pumps , but because of the fresh water , not by the trunts , but because of the forests , or by the fishing boats and their nets , but by the fish in the sea .
H-1086	-0.4521736800670624	You want to feed the world ?
H-1087	-0.44107508659362793	Let &apos;s start to ask us : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
H-1088	-0.4130641520023346	Or better , how can we create the conditions that allow each collectively to feed itself ?
H-1089	-0.6728444695472717	To do it , don &apos;t take the business model for your future .
H-1090	-0.8139707446098328	It &apos;s really old , and he &apos;s usled .
H-1091	-0.8049341440200806	It costs to capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never nothing really good to eat .
H-1092	-1.1219879388809204	In the opposite , let &apos;s inspire the ecological model .
H-1093	-0.7897380590438843	That &apos;s the one that &apos;s based on two billion years of experience .
H-1094	-1.4427952766418457	Look at Migs , the farmers like Migs ,
H-1095	-1.8282793760299683	There &apos;s the agricultural @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ same farms , farms that are moving in the place of it &apos;s moving , farms that are working in the way , but also experts in relationships , but also experts in relationships ,
H-1096	-0.6934661269187927	because they &apos;re also those who are experts in taste .
H-1097	-0.7508564591407776	And , to be totally honest , they &apos;re a better leader that I &apos;m never going to be .
H-1098	-0.5499420166015625	You know , it doesn &apos;t get me , because if it &apos;s that , the future of the right food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
H-1099	-0.8202376365661621	Thank you . I grew up to feed science .
H-1100	-0.8438889384269714	In high school , I &apos;d take the bus to go to school , every day , a hour hour in every sense .
H-1101	-1.3669157028198242	And I was always in a book in a book , a science of science @-@ fiction , who took my mind to other worlds , and I was doing , in his narrative form , my curatiity of then .
H-1102	-0.9410110712051392	And that curiosity was also in the fact that every time I wasn &apos;t at school , I was walking in the wood , to walk and pick up samples of samples , frogs , snakes , insects and water from marites , that I took to look at the microscope .
H-1103	-0.770693302154541	You know , I was a real bit of science .
H-1104	-0.5311900973320007	But it was to try to understand the world , understand the limits of possible .
H-1105	-0.8379582762718201	And my love of science fiction seemed to be reflected in the world that surrounded me , because of all what was going on , we was at the late &apos; 60s , we was going on the moon , we were exploring the ocean of the ocean .
H-1106	-0.9015241861343384	And Jacques Cousteau came in our salons with his incredible emissions that showed us animals and places , and a wonderful world , that we never could never imagine before .
H-1107	-0.8722930550575256	So , we &apos;d say that it &apos;s happening with all the science @-@ fiction side of the time .
H-1108	-0.30310478806495667	And I was a artist .
H-1109	-0.27041128277778625	I could draw . I could paint .
H-1110	-0.7265719175338745	And I realized that , because there was no video games and this film of movies in images , and all this imagery in the media landscape , then I had to create these images in my head .
H-1111	-0.851326584815979	You know , as we all did , like children who read a book and , through the description of the author , which are looking at something on the film of the film in their head .
H-1112	-0.8262812495231628	Well , my answer to that , it was to paint , to draw alien creatures , exotic worlds , robots , space vessels , all these stuff .
H-1113	-1.034576416015625	In math , I was doing all the time @-@ to @-@ hand time behind my book book .
H-1114	-1.4957941770553589	It was -- it was the creativity that had to find his own thing , sort of .
H-1115	-0.9595115780830383	And then a interesting thing happened , a show from Jacques Cousteau really embed me to figure out that there was a alien world , here on Earth .
H-1116	-0.9520152807235718	There &apos;s a little chance I could really go a day on a foreign planet in the spaceship .
H-1117	-1.1827913522720337	It seemed to be very likely .
H-1118	-0.8586040139198303	But there was a world where I could really go to , here , on Earth , and that was also rich and exotic that everything I had could imagine reading these books .
H-1119	-0.9180185198783875	So , I decided to become a sub @-@ submersible in the age of 15 .
H-1120	-0.7266719937324524	And the only problem was that I lived in a small village in Canada , about 1,000 miles of the most close ocean .
H-1121	-0.6535874009132385	But I didn &apos;t let me .
H-1122	-0.8723700046539307	I &apos;ve harked my father until it &apos;s going to dive to Buffalo , New York , just on the other side of the border .
H-1123	-0.5131634473800659	And in fact , I spent my degree in the pool of a YMCA , at the heart of the winter , to Buffalo , New York .
H-1124	-0.6847706437110901	And I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for two years , until we were moving in California .
H-1125	-0.9993767142295837	Since , in the last 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours under the water , 500 hours on submarines .
H-1126	-0.7959774136543274	And I learned something , it &apos;s that this middle of deep ocean , and even the ocean , are so rich of an amazing life that is really beyond our imagination .
H-1127	-0.9355003833770752	The imagination of nature is without limits with our own human human imagination .
H-1128	-1.0729683637619019	Again , I &apos;m in awe of all I see when I &apos;m doing these dives .
H-1129	-0.6603465676307678	And my story of love with the ocean still continues , and it &apos;s also strong that she &apos;s ever been .
H-1130	-0.7671442627906799	But when , adult , I chose a job , it was the film of movies .
H-1131	-0.853603184223175	And it seemed to be the best way to spread this need that I had to tell stories , with my irreverent desire to create images .
H-1132	-1.0567967891693115	When I was a kid , I was cartooned with cartoonists , things like that .
H-1133	-0.8419322967529297	So , the movie was the way to put together pictures and stories . And it had sense .
H-1134	-0.9242073893547058	And of course , the stories I &apos;ve chosen to tell were stories of science @-@ fiction : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alinks , &quot; and on Abyss .
H-1135	-0.9250419735908508	And with &quot; Abyss , &quot; I &apos;ve got it at the same time my love of the sub and diving , with the film of film .
H-1136	-1.3175245523452759	I &apos;ve got to say , they &apos;ve got the two passions .
H-1137	-0.7581151723861694	Something interesting thing came out of old Abyss , which was that to solve a specific problem of storytelling in this film , which was to create a kind of liquid creature , made water , we actually chose animation generated by computer , the image of synthesis .
H-1138	-0.8290737271308899	And it gave the first electronic character in the image that we &apos;ve ever seen in a film .
H-1139	-0.915016233921051	And even if the film didn &apos;t have any money , we &apos;ve just reached the balance , I would say , I &apos;ve seen something incredible : the audience , the public world , was hypnotized by this very magic .
H-1140	-1.1145305633544922	You know , it &apos;s Arthur Clarke &apos;s Law , which says that all much enough technology is unsafe to magic .
H-1141	-1.1334891319274902	People were looking at something magical .
H-1142	-0.9893062710762024	And it &apos;s very excited about it .
H-1143	-0.5106315612792969	And I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s something that has to be adopted by the graphic art art .
H-1144	-0.9849604368209839	So , with &quot; Uator , &quot; which was my next film , we &apos;ve got this much further .
H-1145	-0.8152843713760376	In working with ILM , we &apos;ve created the guy in liquid metal of the film . The success was in fact that this effect works or not .
H-1146	-0.6546145081520081	And it worked . And again we created magic .
H-1147	-0.5432184338569641	And we had the same result with the audience .
H-1148	-0.6114957332611084	Even if we &apos;ve done a little more money on this .
H-1149	-0.8818657398223877	So , by taking a trait between these two points of experience , what we &apos;d come at , that it was going to be a new world , it was a new world of creativity for film artists .
H-1150	-0.5838162302970886	So , I put a company with Stan Winston , my dear friend , Stan Winston , who was the best designer designer and creatures at the time , and we called &quot; Digital Domain . &quot;
H-1151	-1.5460803508758545	And the concept of society was to be directly directly on top of the analog @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ time process .
H-1152	-0.9048372507095337	What we &apos;ve done and we gave us a competition for a certain time .
H-1153	-0.7961691617965698	But we took the late in the middle of the &apos; 90s in the design of characters and creatures that we &apos;ve created this society .
H-1154	-1.0226516723632812	So , I wrote this scenario that I called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which had to be able to actually push the borders of visual effects , digital effects , with human characters , capable of emotions , generous in the image of synthesis . And the main characters would be in a picture of synthesis . And the world would be in image of synthesis . And the world would be in the image of synthesis . And the world would be in the image of synthesis . And we &apos;re going to push the borders .
H-1155	-0.7269495725631714	And there &apos;s the guy from my society told me that we didn &apos;t be able to do that before a good moment .
H-1156	-1.0158977508544922	So I put it on the side , and I &apos;ve done this other film on a big ship that goes on .
H-1157	-0.6355050206184387	You know , I went to summarize this in the studio like &quot; Romleo and Juliet on a boat . &quot;
H-1158	-0.8078941702842712	It &apos;s going to be a epic and romantic film , a passionate movie .
H-1159	-0.7463627457618713	In secret , what I wanted to do was dive on the real piece of the Titanic &apos;s &quot; Titanic . &quot;
H-1160	-0.4321900010108948	And that &apos;s why I did the film .
H-1161	-0.3489168584346771	And that &apos;s the truth . Okay , the studio didn &apos;t know .
H-1162	-0.5323919057846069	But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive on the spave . We &apos;re going to film it for true .
H-1163	-0.7941775321960449	We &apos;ll use it for the openness of the film .
H-1164	-0.6715717911720276	It &apos;s going to be really important . It &apos;s going to be a great marketing . &quot;
H-1165	-0.7895166277885437	And I told them to fund a expedition .
H-1166	-0.6271542310714722	It seems crazy . But we &apos;re back to this idea of your imagination that creates reality .
H-1167	-0.9071311354637146	Because we &apos;ve actually created a reality where six months later I was looking in a Russian submersible , at four miles of depth in the North Atlantic , looking at the real real Titanic , not a film , not from HD , but for true .
H-1168	-0.9067668318748474	Seriously , I was in the shock of shock .
H-1169	-0.4359532594680786	It took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
H-1170	-0.9514340758323669	But it struck me how much this dive , these deep deep deep , looked at a space mission .
H-1171	-0.6573049426078796	You know , this very technical side , and it requires a lot of planning .
H-1172	-0.7707232236862183	You go into this capsule , you go into this dark and hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope of rescue if you don &apos;t get to get out of you .
H-1173	-0.5457438230514526	And I thought , &quot; Wow . It &apos;s like I was living in a film of science .
H-1174	-0.2386876940727234	It &apos;s really cool . &quot;
H-1175	-1.1328409910202026	And yeah , I &apos;ve really been morted by the virus of the exploration of ocean funds .
H-1176	-0.7904372215270996	Of course , even curiosity , and the scientific side .
H-1177	-0.6279770731925964	It was all this . It was the adventure , it was curiosity . It was the imagination .
H-1178	-0.5437795519828796	And this was a experiment that Hollywood could not give me .
H-1179	-0.34385478496551514	Because , you know , I could imagine a creature , and we could create a visual effect for her . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I saw by this window .
H-1180	-1.1144139766693115	And in some of our remote expeditions I &apos;ve seen creatures at the chimthertherth and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had never seen before , who had never been described by science at the time we saw them and baby .
H-1181	-1.020006537437439	So , I &apos;m really fallen out of crazy out of this , and it took me more again .
H-1182	-0.5314456224441528	And so I took a pretty curious decision .
H-1183	-0.6684565544128418	After the success of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to put my job job of movies in Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to be exploring in time for a moment . &quot;
H-1184	-0.5834945440292358	And we started the planning of these expeditions .
H-1185	-0.9612402319908142	And we &apos;ve found us to explore the Bisle , and explore it with robotic vehicles .
H-1186	-0.5697868466377258	We went back to the Titanic of the Titanic .
H-1187	-1.1823861598968506	We took the little robots that we &apos;ve created , the ones that were able to have fiber fiber .
H-1188	-0.7041587233543396	The idea was to go in , and do a study of the inside of this ship , which was never been done .
H-1189	-0.7042973041534424	No one had never looked at the interior . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , but we &apos;ve created technology to do it .
H-1190	-0.7571226358413696	So here , I &apos;m now , there , on the bridge of the Titanic , sitting in a submersible , looking at the glits that look like a lot of these , where I knew the orchestra had played .
H-1191	-1.045084834098816	And I &apos;m in a little robotic vehicle that &apos;s going through the ship of the ship .
H-1192	-0.5251104831695557	In fact , I control it back , but my mind is in the vehicle .
H-1193	-1.0275368690490723	I felt like that if I was physically physically in the interior of the Titanic .
H-1194	-1.297383189201355	And that was the most overrealistic experience of already that I &apos;ve ever lived , because before we take a turn , I already knew what there was going to be there , before the vehicle lights the vehicle , because I &apos;d have arped the stage of the next month when we were doing the film .
H-1195	-1.2368253469467163	And the stage was built like a accurate @-@ based of the ship plans .
H-1196	-0.5062994956970215	Yes , it was a absolutely remarkable experience .
H-1197	-1.0808396339416504	And it really did me understand one thing , the experience of the prepreess , that you can really prove with these robotic robotic avatars , that your consciousness is injected in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
H-1198	-0.7676844596862793	It was really very profound .
H-1199	-0.8671852946281433	And maybe a little glimpse of what &apos;s going to happen in a few decades , when we &apos;ll start to have the body body for exploration or other goals in many post @-@ human future , as I can imagine , as a fan of science .
H-1200	-0.8319147229194641	So , after having these expeditions , and really started to appreciate what there was there , down , like these chimchimers in the ocean of the ocean , where we had these fascinating animals .
H-1201	-0.8741258978843689	They &apos;re strangers in the real sense of the term , here , on Earth .
H-1202	-1.1388981342315674	They &apos;re living in a photosynthesis environment .
H-1203	-0.505221962928772	They don &apos;t survive in a system based on the light of the Sun , as we do it .
H-1204	-1.0268362760543823	And then you can see animals that live on the hot water of hot water , more than 500 degrees C .
H-1205	-1.0872942209243774	We wouldn &apos;t get that they could exist .
H-1206	-0.8051555752754211	At the same time I started to be also very interested in space science , again , the influence of science science , as when I was a kid .
H-1207	-1.2624688148498535	And I ended up to be involved in the space community , really involved with NASA , to school to the NASA Council of NASA , to plan real missions in space , to go to Russia , follow the protocolations to the selection selection , and all these kinds of things , in the goal of getting fly for good to the international Station with our 3D cameras systems .
H-1208	-0.5007838010787964	And it was fascinating .
H-1209	-0.6627182364463806	But what I ended up to do is to bring scientists from space with us in the depths .
H-1210	-1.0572208166122437	And take them back to the bottom , they have access , astrobiologists , scientists &apos;s scientists , people interested in these extreme environments , to go them down to the chimakes , and let them see , take samples , take their test instruments , and so forth .
H-1211	-1.2241874933242798	Now , there , we &apos;re going to have some documented movies , but actually we was doing science , and even space science .
H-1212	-0.8707575798034668	I had completely moving the loop between the science of science , you know , the kid , and do this kind of things for true .
H-1213	-0.7576865553855896	And you know , all of this journey of discovery , I &apos;ve got a lot of learned .
H-1214	-0.6608285903930664	I &apos;ve learned a lot about science . But I &apos;ve also learned a lot about leadership .
H-1215	-0.7241990566253662	You &apos;re telling you that a stage of the stage has to be a leader , a leader , a captain of the ship , and all of this kind of thing .
H-1216	-0.6171824932098389	I didn &apos;t really learned a lot about leadership until I did these expeditions .
H-1217	-0.5915268659591675	Because I had to , at some point , tell me , &quot; What do I do here ?
H-1218	-0.6247918605804443	Why am I doing it ? What should I take it ? &quot;
H-1219	-1.07376229763031	We don &apos;t do any money with these emissions of emissions .
H-1220	-1.019745111465454	We &apos;re getting it right . It doesn &apos;t give any glory .
H-1221	-1.5439317226409912	The people had to think that I was left , between the old Titanic , and that I had to be to polr the nails somewhere somewhere , sitting on a beach .
H-1222	-1.085461139678955	You &apos;ve done all these films , these documented movies , that was going to be a very limited audience .
H-1223	-1.0019690990447998	No glory , no money , no money . But what are you going to do ?
H-1224	-0.7789579033851624	We &apos;re doing it for the thing itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the environment with the most challenges that &apos;s -- for the pleasure of discovery , and for this strange connection that &apos;s making when a small group of people form a very uprised team .
H-1225	-0.5988783836364746	Because these are things that we do with 10 @-@ 12 people working together for years .
H-1226	-1.4210389852523804	Sometimes , went back to two @-@ 3 @-@ three months .
H-1227	-0.6075028777122498	And in this link , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have to them and they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain somebody else .
H-1229	-0.8213111162185669	It &apos;s creating a link , it creates a respect of respect .
H-1230	-0.7446714639663696	So , when I came back to do my next film , which was &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to apply this same principle of leadership that is that you &apos;re doing your team , and you get their respect back .
H-1231	-0.635640025138855	And it really changed the dynamics .
H-1232	-0.8109104037284851	So , I went back with a little team , in the unknown territory , &quot; Avatar , &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t before .
H-1233	-1.0593949556350708	It &apos;s very exciting .
H-1234	-1.3504834175109863	It &apos;s very hard .
H-1235	-0.512195348739624	And we became a family , on a four @-@ year @-@ old period .
H-1236	-0.6738682389259338	And it completely changed the way I &apos;m doing films .
H-1237	-0.8310216069221497	So people made observations on the way that I &apos;d brought the ocean organisms to put them on the planet &apos;s planet .
H-1238	-0.8151593804359436	For me , it was more about how to do business , the process itself , which has changed on this .
H-1239	-0.9755151867866516	So what synthesis can we pull out of this ?
H-1240	-0.43731191754341125	You know , what are the lessons we learned ?
H-1241	-0.7697955369949341	Well , I think in number one we have : curiosity .
H-1242	-0.5885447263717651	It &apos;s the most powerful thing you have .
H-1243	-0.8851062059402466	The imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
H-1244	-0.6230781078338623	And the respect of your team is more important than all of the lauors in the world .
H-1245	-1.0028083324432373	There &apos;s young filmers who come to me : I &apos;ll tell me about advice to do this . &quot;
H-1246	-0.901096522808075	And I &apos;m saying , &quot; You don &apos;t give you the limitations .
H-1247	-0.5069104433059692	Other people will do it for you , don &apos;t do it for yourself , don &apos;t play against yourself .
H-1248	-0.5360007286071777	And take risks . &quot;
H-1249	-1.0070827007293701	At NASA , they have this sentence that &apos;s like , &quot; Well , failure is not a option . &quot;
H-1250	-0.3733641803264618	But failure has to be an option in art and exploration , because it &apos;s an act of faith .
H-1251	-0.9726194739341736	And no important effort that demanded innovations has been done without risks .
H-1252	-0.8613811135292053	You &apos;ve got to be able to take these risks .
H-1254	-1.1340022087097168	So what we &apos;ve got here is a high @-@ organized death painting in age .
H-1255	-0.5386354327201843	The tool I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
H-1256	-0.7056841254234314	It &apos;s called Pivt , and with Pivt I can choose to focus on a cause of deaths in particular , say accidents .
H-1257	-0.6075934171676636	And , immediately , I see a different trend that emerges .
H-1258	-0.5382077693939209	It &apos;s because , in the middle of the middle , people are the most active , and here they &apos;re the most fragile .
H-1259	-1.1314018964767456	We can get again and reorganize the data by the causes of deaths , we see that the cardio diseases and cancer are used to be used , but not for everybody .
H-1260	-0.9409053921699524	If we keep on and you filter by age , let &apos;s say 40 or less , we see that accidents are actually the biggest cause people should worry about .
H-1261	-0.8003361225128174	And if we &apos;re going to get a little bit , it &apos;s particularly true for men .
H-1262	-0.9464130401611328	Anyway , you understand the idea that see information , see the data of this way , looks a lot to swim in a living data of graphic data .
H-1263	-0.6900186538696289	And if we can do that with brutes data , why don &apos;t we do it with content as well ?
H-1264	-0.8206578493118286	So what we &apos;ve got here is the cover of every number of Sports called Sports .
H-1265	-0.6121028661727905	It &apos;s there . It &apos;s online .
H-1266	-0.7882484197616577	You can go home and try after my presentation .
H-1267	-0.8804908990859985	With Pivt , you can zoom in a decade .
H-1268	-0.587318480014801	You can zoom in a particular year .
H-1269	-0.6810296177864075	You can make you directly on a specific number .
H-1270	-0.6875845193862915	So I look at that ; I see the athletes that &apos;s gone in this number , sports .
H-1271	-0.7541048526763916	I &apos;m a fan of Lance Armstrong , so I &apos;m going to click on this , which I &apos;m seeing all the numbers in which Lance Armstrong is mentioned .
H-1272	-0.7860156297683716	Now , if I just want to take a look at the eye , I could tell me , &quot; Well , and if we looked at all that &apos;s talking about cyclism ? &quot;
H-1273	-0.530624270439148	So I can take a little step , and explore this idea .
H-1274	-0.9855936169624329	And I &apos;ll see Greg Lemond now .
H-1275	-1.1848593950271606	And you start to understand the idea that when you &apos;re navigating in the information of this way , in a little bit , and you &apos;re moving up , you &apos;re moving up , you &apos;re not navigating .
H-1276	-0.5187697410583496	You do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
H-1277	-0.5391893982887268	It &apos;s between both , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
H-1278	-0.5646252632141113	And I &apos;d like to extrapolate this idea a little bit with something that &apos;s slightly crazy .
H-1279	-0.8643056750297546	What we &apos;ve done here is that we took every page of Wikipedia and we &apos;ve got a little summary .
H-1280	-1.1982983350753784	So the summary is just made from small nonosis and a icon to indicate the theme that he comes from .
H-1281	-0.9626545310020447	I &apos;m just showing you the first 500 pages of Wikipedia .
H-1282	-0.5407538414001465	But even in this limited view , we can do a bunch of things .
H-1283	-0.9608454704284668	Immediately , we &apos;ve got a idea of the global areas that are the most popular on Wikipedia .
H-1284	-1.0907849073410034	I &apos;m going to go to me and choose the government .
H-1285	-1.5366754531860352	Now , having government government , I can now see that the categories of Wikipedia that correspond to that are the most common I &apos;ve got to be the most @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day of the magazine magazine .
H-1286	-0.9963957667350769	And it &apos;s important because it &apos;s a infromation that was not in any of the pages of Wikipedia .
H-1287	-0.8576111793518066	It &apos;s possible to do this observation that it &apos;s taking back and looking at them .
H-1288	-1.5112148523330688	As you look at one of these particular summares , I can now dig the concept of Personality of the Time magazine , in the posters .
H-1289	-1.0185528993606567	And when you look at these people , I see that the majority of the government come from .
H-1290	-1.0787246227264404	Some of them are natural science .
H-1291	-1.1873575448989868	Other , less many , come from the world of business .
H-1292	-0.5429583191871643	That &apos;s my boss .
H-1293	-0.5937306880950928	And one comes from the world &apos;s world .
H-1294	-0.9339373111724854	And interesting , Bono is also a Nobel Prize Prize .
H-1295	-1.1066004037857056	So we can continue , move , and throw a look at all the Nobel Prize Prize .
H-1296	-0.7596505284309387	And you see , we &apos;re walking the network for the first time as if it was actually a network , no page in page , but at a higher degree of abstraction .
H-1297	-0.7320273518562317	And also I &apos;d like to show you another thing that could make you a little bit of surprise .
H-1298	-0.740432620048523	I just show you the website of the New York Times here .
H-1299	-0.6684638261795044	So Pithit , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can visit web pages with -- and we &apos;re putting this technology technology for every web page like this .
H-1300	-0.8658401370048523	So I can get away , go back to a particular section .
H-1301	-0.6943295001983643	And the reason that it &apos;s important is that , being able to get the web pages of this way I can look at all the history of my navigation exactly in the same way .
H-1302	-0.7881346344947815	So I can dig in what I &apos;ve done in the course of some time of time .
H-1303	-0.9787434339523315	The way , in fact , it &apos;s the state of all the demo I just gave .
H-1304	-0.8451519012451172	And I can play some of the things I &apos;ve got earlier today .
H-1305	-0.9303581118583679	And , if I want to get away and look at me , I can decorate my history maybe my research history .
H-1306	-1.559802532196045	Now , I &apos;m doing a lot of research research , doing research for Bing , here for the Pithit &apos;s .
H-1307	-0.924756646156311	And from that , I can dive into the Web page and just throw them again .
H-1308	-0.8233156204223633	It &apos;s a metaphor reused multiple times , and at every time it makes the whole larger than the sum of the parts with the data .
H-1309	-1.3881380558013916	And at this moment , in this world , we think the data are this mistse .
H-1310	-0.6991496086120605	We &apos;re talking about the problem of information overload .
H-1311	-0.6970285177230835	We &apos;re talking about being drowned under the data .
H-1312	-1.154043197631836	And if we could actually go back and get the web , so instead of one thing to the other , we &apos;re going to go to a whole set of things to another together , and that doing being able to be able to get the trends that without that would have been hidden ?
H-1313	-0.6494601964950562	If we can do that , then , rather than being prisoner , we could actually extract information .
H-1314	-0.832375705242157	And , rather than only to manage information , we can extract knowledge .
H-1315	-0.8789812922477722	And if we have the knowledge , then there may be even wisdom to take it .
H-1316	-0.8012098670005798	And with that , I thank you . Suppose we &apos;ve got here a machine , a big machine , at the TED mode , a traveling machine in time .
H-1317	-1.2757179737091064	Each of us here has to go up .
H-1318	-0.5652540922164917	You can go back or before you can &apos;t stay where you are .
H-1319	-1.099902868270874	I &apos;m asking me what you would say because I asked my friends : they all wanted to go back .
H-1320	-0.9867323040962219	They wanted to go back before the automobiles or Twitter or the New York .
H-1321	-0.22467651963233948	I don &apos;t know .
H-1322	-1.2285600900650024	There &apos;s a kind of attractive @-@ to @-@ the @-@ like @-@ the @-@ hand .
H-1323	-0.6667583584785461	I understand that .
H-1324	-0.751122772693634	I &apos;ve got to say that I don &apos;t do it .
H-1325	-0.9578835964202881	I don &apos;t want to go up by lack of a adventous mind , but for the possibilities of this planet . They &apos;re not remote , they &apos;re moving .
H-1326	-0.8904891610145569	So I want to get up in this machine and move .
H-1327	-0.9673182368278503	It &apos;s the largest moment that there &apos;s ever been on this planet what it &apos;s the measure of measure : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , rates of disease .
H-1328	-0.9342631697654724	There &apos;s never been like that time .
H-1329	-0.7569639086723328	My great @-@ grandparents are all dead before I had 60 years old .
H-1330	-1.2065653800964355	My grandparents got up to 70 .
H-1331	-1.4889097213745117	My parents &apos;s coming to the 80 .
H-1332	-0.8689910173416138	So I &apos;d like to be well that there &apos;s a nine at the beginning of my death age .
H-1333	-0.5494800806045532	But it &apos;s not just people like us because it &apos;s more general than that .
H-1334	-0.7126672267913818	A kid who &apos;s born in New Delhi today can hope as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
H-1335	-0.5321385860443115	Think about it . It &apos;s an incredible fact .
H-1336	-0.47062915563583374	Why is this true ?
H-1337	-0.474743127822876	smallpox : she killed billions of people on this planet .
H-1338	-0.9106064438819885	It &apos;s got demographics on the globe like no war never did .
H-1339	-0.5693489909172058	It &apos;s finished . She &apos;s gone .
H-1340	-1.4773612022399902	We defeated it .
H-1341	-1.064597487449646	In the rich world , diseases that were threatening millions of us , there &apos;s a generation of us exist much more .
H-1342	-1.7121682167053223	The diphic , the ruins , polio --
H-1343	-1.1473230123519897	Does anybody know what it is ?
H-1344	-0.6236560940742493	vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , they &apos;re the triumph of the scientific method .
H-1345	-0.7178105711936951	In my mind , the scientific method , trying to do things , see if they work , change it , it &apos;s one of the great advances of humanity .
H-1346	-0.5108845829963684	That &apos;s the good news .
H-1347	-0.7603976130485535	Unfortunately , it &apos;s the only good news because there are other problems , mentioned several times , and one of them , despite all of our successes , it &apos;s one billion people go up in the world , every day .
H-1348	-1.3699675798416138	It &apos;s the number of the number of it is , very quickly , and it &apos;s just very old .
H-1349	-0.9942116737365723	Pire , we &apos;ve used our imagination to polluate this planet .
H-1350	-1.0031228065490723	The drinking water , the clay , the rainforest , the oil , the oil , the gas : they &apos;re moving quickly and at less innovate to get out of this mess , we &apos;re going to disappear .
H-1351	-0.470016747713089	The question is , can we do it ? I think yes .
H-1352	-0.5413248538970947	It &apos;s clear that we can do food for billions of people without raped the land on which they live .
H-1353	-0.6917515397071838	I think we can produce enough energy without having destroying the world .
H-1354	-0.4795564115047455	I really believe it . It &apos;s not a utopian .
H-1355	-1.011802077293396	Here &apos;s what makes me night , one of the things that prevent me to sleep .
H-1356	-0.8006505966186523	We &apos;ve never had as much the science now . We &apos;ve never been no longer able to use it as we can today .
H-1357	-0.8726886510848999	We &apos;re a lot of amazing events in many areas .
H-1358	-0.7688905000686646	Yet , I think we &apos;ve got to go back to 300 years before the time of the Enlighteners to find a period where we &apos;re fighting the progress , when we &apos;re fighting these things more strong and on more time now .
H-1359	-1.4648635387420654	People are locked in their beliefs of ways that you can &apos;t release them .
H-1360	-0.5415151715278625	Even the truth doesn &apos;t .
H-1361	-0.6926344633102417	Each is free of his opinions , each one can think what it wants to be progress , but you know what you can &apos;t do ?
H-1362	-0.587791383266449	You can &apos;t get the facts . Sorry , we can &apos;t .
H-1363	-0.7856148481369019	It took me time to understand it .
H-1364	-0.4475727081298828	10 years ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for the New Yorker .
H-1365	-0.7156701683998108	I was surprised to meet the opposition to what was , after everything , the most effective measure of all the human history .
H-1366	-0.5833399295806885	I didn &apos;t know what to do . I just wrote a story , and I &apos;ve spent something else .
H-1367	-0.6935617923736572	A little bit later , I wrote a story on a genetically modified food .
H-1368	-0.959968090057373	Same thing , worse .
H-1369	-1.368975281715393	People were crazy .
H-1370	-0.8978758454322815	So , I wrote a story about it and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought about &quot; Frankenfast . &quot; Why &apos;s the fact to move the molecules in a organized way , it was to spend the laws of nature ?
H-1371	-0.5107752084732056	You know , I &apos;m doing my work : I write the article and here .
H-1372	-0.596568763256073	I mean , I &apos;m a journalist , we &apos;ll say , we &apos;re going to dinner , it &apos;s good .
H-1373	-1.1540906429290771	But these stories got me off . I ended up to understand why .
H-1374	-1.6694204807281494	Well , because these dans who were going to be crazy wasn &apos;t old of all .
H-1375	-1.6121797561645508	It &apos;s a lot of people , educated , as you have ,
H-1376	-0.811056911945343	exactly like people in this room .
H-1377	-1.2440316677093506	It &apos;s so long .
H-1378	-0.9601288437843323	And I thought , let &apos;s be honest : we &apos;re at a point in this world where we &apos;ve got the same report to the progress before .
H-1379	-1.116892695426941	We &apos;re talking about a ambient way .
H-1380	-1.1765167713165283	We &apos;re talking about this ironic way , &quot; The Progress . &quot;
H-1381	-0.6169507503509521	There are reasons for that and I think we know it .
H-1382	-0.5716277360916138	We &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority and sometimes in science . There &apos;s no reasons to not have lost it .
H-1383	-1.148805856704712	It &apos;s just to give you some names and people understand .
H-1384	-1.4789278507232666	Tar nobyl , Bhospital , &#91; Unclear , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , votes .
H-1385	-0.5776411294937134	You can do your list .
H-1386	-0.8352519869804382	There &apos;s questions and problems about people that we thought we &apos;ve always thought .
H-1387	-1.5040621757507324	Let &apos;s be skeptical .
H-1388	-1.483603835105896	You &apos;re doing questions , require evidence .
H-1389	-0.6750872135162354	Don &apos;t take anything for money .
H-1390	-0.4930131435394287	But here &apos;s the thing : when you have evidence , you have to accept evidence . We &apos;re not good for that .
H-1391	-0.7741474509239197	The reason is that we &apos;re in a fear of fear as I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see .
H-1392	-1.4993455410003662	12 years ago was published a horrible story that connected the epidemic of autism against the comic , the pilflies and the ruins .
H-1393	-2.04215145111084	It &apos;s going to take it .
H-1394	-1.203627347946167	There &apos;s a couple of studies of studies have been done to see if it was true .
H-1395	-0.46705159544944763	They had to be done , it &apos;s a very serious subject .
H-1396	-1.4022066593170166	The results are come back .
H-1397	-0.6345897912979126	In the United States , England , Sweden , Canada , all the same : no correlation , no link , nothing .
H-1398	-0.8801055550575256	It doesn &apos;t matter because we believe the anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we &apos;re seeing , what we feel real .

H-1562	-1.2579811811447144	In playing music , and talking about music , this man turned up , in the final man , paranoia , who would get in the streets of the Los Angeles of Los Angeles , in this charant , husaid , and brilliant musician of Juilliard .
H-1563	-0.6802619099617004	The music is medicine . The music changes .
H-1564	-0.2627435028553009	And for Nathaniel , music is mental health .
H-1565	-1.0374066829681396	Because the music allows him to take his thoughts and his passions , and bring them through his imagination and creativity , in the reality .
H-1566	-1.5046762228012085	And it &apos;s a perasion of his toral state .
H-1567	-0.6874270439147949	And I understood that it was the essence of art .
H-1568	-0.699802577495575	It &apos;s the reason that we &apos;ve created music , to take something that exists in each other of us , at the most fundamental level of our being , our emotions , and thanks to our artistic , our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape these emotions in reality .
H-1569	-1.240315556526184	And the reality of that expression has all of us , and we &apos;ve moved , we &apos;re all on us and we &apos;re getting .
H-1570	-1.0047935247421265	And in what &apos;s Nathaniel , music brought it in among his friends .
H-1571	-1.120431900024414	The power power of music brought it in the family of the musicians who understood it , have recognized its talents and respected it .
H-1572	-0.8007136583328247	And I &apos;ll always continue to do music with Nathaniel , that we &apos;re in Walt Disney Det , or about Sold Row , because it reminds me why I became a musician .
H-1573	-0.11344344168901443	Thank you .
H-1574	-0.27842867374420166	I thank you . Thank you .
H-1575	-1.812928318977356	Robert Gupta .
H-1576	-1.4838882684707642	I want to play something that I &apos;ve been supposed to get stole to the cello .
H-1577	-0.9138035774230957	So , please me . There &apos;s several years ago , here in Ted , Peter Sink presented a design of design called the marshmallow of the marshmallow .
H-1578	-0.39730727672576904	And the idea is pretty simple .
H-1579	-1.1338179111480713	There &apos;s a teams of four people have to build the highest structure holding up with 20 spaghetti , a square tape , a meter meter , and a marshmallow .
H-1580	-1.023508071899414	The marshmallow has to be placed at the top .
H-1581	-0.910851001739502	Although it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s actually rather difficult , because it &apos;s getting people to collaborate quickly .
H-1582	-0.6564440727233887	I found that it was a interesting idea , then I put it into a design shop .
H-1583	-0.6417175531387329	And it &apos;s been a great success .
H-1584	-0.928387463092804	Since , I &apos;ve been run about 70 design workshops in the entire world , with students , designers and architects , and even the Directors @-@ and @-@ the @-@ 50 , and there &apos;s something in this exercise that reveals deep in the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of you with you .
H-1585	-1.0902491807937622	Okay , normally most people start starting to take their brands with the task .
H-1586	-0.7263363599777222	They &apos;re talking about , they &apos;re looking about what it &apos;s going to look like , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to power , and then they spend a little bit of time to plan , to organize .
H-1587	-1.1576422452926636	They &apos;re doing sketches , and they &apos;re looking at the spaghetti . They spend the most part of their time to assemble the sticks and bigger @-@ and @-@ bigger , and then , at the end , just when the time gets closer , somebody takes the marshmallow , and the asks it to the top , and then they go back , and ... Ta @-@ daaa !
H-1588	-0.8901787400245667	They &apos;re looking at their work .
H-1589	-0.9466468691825867	But in fact , what happens , most of the time is that the &quot; ta &apos;s &quot; &quot; oh &quot; &quot; oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow fact that all the structure &apos;s going down and it turns out .
H-1590	-0.8084567785263062	There &apos;s a number of participants that have much more than &quot; oh , &quot; that others , and , among the worst , the young people in trade schools .
H-1591	-0.7864373326301575	They lie , they cheat , they &apos;re distracted , and the structures that they produce are really boitous .
H-1592	-0.8614290356636047	And of course , there are teams that produce much more structures , &quot; ta , &quot; and , among the best , the young schools of schools .
H-1593	-0.4222707152366638	And it &apos;s really amazing .
H-1594	-0.6716909408569336	As the says Peter , not only they produce the higher structures , but it &apos;s also the most interesting structures .
H-1595	-0.9943929314613342	So , the question that we ask is : How did that happen ? Why did they have special ?
H-1596	-0.9510260224342346	Peter likes to say this : &quot; No children has spent one minute to try to become Director Technic Spagc Spagc . &quot; It &apos;s true .
H-1597	-1.244930386543274	They &apos;re not going to spend their time to manegg for power .
H-1598	-0.44139549136161804	But there &apos;s also another reason .
H-1599	-0.9605476260185242	It &apos;s that the students students are trained to find the unique plan that will work .
H-1600	-0.9801941514015198	And then put it into work .
H-1601	-0.6746772527694702	And then what happens , when they ask the marshmallow to the top , they don &apos;t have their rest of time , and then ?
H-1602	-0.48049694299697876	This is the crisis .
H-1603	-1.4288722276687622	So , what &apos;s something about this ? It &apos;s done .
H-1604	-0.9011106491088867	What the kindergarten teams do differently is that they start by the marshmallow , and building prototypes , prototypes , having the marshmallow to the top , and so many opportunities to fix prototypes in difficulty .
H-1605	-0.9883771538734436	The designers will recognize this kind of cooperation like the basic basis of the iterative process .
H-1606	-1.3280879259109497	With every version , kids have a feedback @-@ to @-@ the @-@ way information on what works or not .
H-1607	-0.5785055160522461	So , the ability to work with prototypes is essential , but let &apos;s see what the results of the different teams .
H-1608	-0.964206337928772	The average for most of the people &apos;s 50 inches , for the students of trade schools , about half of half , lawyers , a little bit better , but not a lot , and for the same , better than for the majority of adults .
H-1609	-0.5120149254798889	Who are really the best ?
H-1610	-0.6631813645362854	The architects and the engineers , fortunately !
H-1611	-0.6986442804336548	A meter , it &apos;s the highest structure I &apos;ve seen .
H-1612	-0.7276650071144104	And why ? Because they understand that triangles and self @-@ porters are the key to build stable structures .
H-1613	-0.9101515412330627	The managers techniques , so , do a little better than the average .
H-1614	-0.5971693396568298	But here &apos;s where it &apos;s interesting .
H-1615	-1.1702741384506226	If we add a administrative framework at the team , the results are growing in a significant way .
H-1616	-0.365575909614563	It &apos;s incredible . You know , you look around you , and you say , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s CETTE team that &apos;s going to win . &quot;
H-1617	-1.112478494644165	We can tell it to the advance . And why ?
H-1618	-1.2706828117370605	Because they &apos;ve got these particular skills of facilititation .
H-1619	-1.1363064050674438	They &apos;re going to get the process , they &apos;re able to understand it .
H-1620	-1.5368191003799438	And the whole team that runs and follows with a big attention of the living work will be able to be meaningful in the performance .
H-1621	-1.3708469867706299	specialized skills and skills skills , their combination leads to success .
H-1622	-1.0414605140686035	If you &apos;ve got 10 teams running , six , maybe , will make a structure that &apos;s standing on .
H-1623	-0.20720423758029938	And I tried something interesting .
H-1624	-0.7667850852012634	I thought , &quot; This time , let &apos;s take the game . &quot;
H-1625	-0.9861579537391663	So I &apos;ve offered a price of a 10 @-@ dollar value to the winning team .
H-1626	-0.7364819645881653	And what do you think it happened to these design students ?
H-1627	-0.5821330547332764	What was the result ?
H-1628	-0.44692447781562805	Here &apos;s what happened .
H-1629	-1.691265344619751	Not a single team had a structure holding up there .
H-1630	-0.7542444467544556	If one one had built , let &apos;s say , a three @-@ inch structure , they &apos;d have taken the price at the house !
H-1631	-1.1760581731796265	So , isn &apos;t it interesting , that high @-@ high @-@ up @-@ a @-@ impact impact ?
H-1632	-0.5979779362678528	We &apos;ve made the exercise with the same students .
H-1633	-0.7551397681236267	What do you think it &apos;s happened ?
H-1634	-1.2983852624893188	Now , they &apos;ve got the importance of the prototyping .
H-1635	-1.0954738855361938	And the same team has happened from the world &apos;s group to the best .
H-1636	-0.8815077543258667	They &apos;ve realized the highest structure in the most short time .
H-1637	-0.6742812991142273	There &apos;s a big lessons for us , about the nature of motivations and success .
H-1638	-1.2328591346740723	So , you might ask you , &quot; Why &apos;s somebody on time to organize a &quot; Lproof of the Marve ? &quot;
H-1639	-0.602898359298706	The reason is that I help to create digital tools and processes that help teams to make automobiles , video games , and special effects .
H-1640	-1.3989795446395874	And what &apos;s what the Marist of the Martain , it &apos;s that it helps them to identify hidden prejudges .
H-1641	-0.3582102954387665	Because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , right ?
H-1642	-0.8935583233833313	The competition brings a shared experience , a common language , a common attitude to build the &quot; prototype . &quot;
H-1643	-0.6956108808517456	And that &apos;s this , the value of this experiment , of this exercise so simple .
H-1644	-1.694233775138855	And the ones that it &apos;s going to go to the marshmalap@-@ a @-@ .com .
H-1645	-1.230539083480835	It &apos;s a blog that you can &apos;t get on the way to drive the &quot; Look of the Mart . &quot;
H-1646	-0.6746139526367188	There &apos;s no instructions to not .
H-1647	-1.0457124710083008	There &apos;s some crazy examples of the whole world , how people torks and adjusting the system .
H-1648	-0.5984591245651245	There &apos;s also the world of the world .
H-1649	-0.5756518840789795	And the fundamental lesson , I think , is that design is really a sport sport .
H-1650	-0.9171702861785889	It requires that we &apos;re bringing all of our senses to task , and we &apos;re looking at the best of our thinking , of our felt and our application to the challenge we have in front of us .
H-1651	-0.7119084596633911	And , sometimes , a little prototype of this experiment will be the only thing that will allow us to do a &quot; oh &quot; a &quot; a &quot; ta . &quot;
H-1652	-0.7258339524269104	And it can make a big difference .
H-1653	-0.22337691485881805	Thank you very much .
