 You know, one of the intense pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones pol@@ ished by rain, taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants. 
 Just to know that J@@ agu@@ ar sham@@ ans still journey beyond the Milky W@@ ay, or the my@@ ths of the Inu@@ it elders still reson@@ ate with meaning, or that in the Himalay@@ a, the Buddhis@@ ts still pursue the breath of the Dhar@@ ma, is to really remember the central revel@@ ation of anthropolog@@ y, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality, the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our line@@ age made, al@@ be@@ it success@@ fully, many generations ago. 
 And of course, we all share the same adaptive imper@@ atives. 
 We're all born. We all bring our children into the world. 
 We go through initi@@ ation r@@ ites. 
 We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have art. 
 But what's interesting is the unique cad@@ ence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture. 
 And whether it is the Pen@@ an in the forests of Bor@@ ne@@ o, or the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in Haiti, or the warri@@ ors in the K@@ ai@@ su@@ t desert of Northern Kenya, the Cur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the An@@ des, or a carav@@ an@@ serai in the middle of the Sahara -- this is incident@@ ally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slo@@ pes of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma, Everest, the god@@ des@@ s mother of the world. 
 All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orient@@ ing yourself in the Earth. 
 And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope. 
 Now, together the myri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelop@@ s the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere. 
 And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere, and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myth@@ s, ideas, inspir@@ ations, intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness. 
 The eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity's great leg@@ acy. 
 It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonish@@ ingly inqu@@ isi@@ tive species. 
 And just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded, so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and, if anything, at a far greater rate. 
 No biolog@@ ists, for example, would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extinction because it simply is not true, and yet that -- the most apocalyp@@ tic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scar@@ cel@@ y approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity. 
 And the great indic@@ ator of that, of course, is language loss. 
 When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet. 
 Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of gram@@ mati@@ cal rules. 
 A language is a flash of the human spirit. 
 It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world. 
 Every language is an old-@@ growth forest of the mind, a water@@ sh@@ ed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities. 
 And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey, fully half are no longer being whisper@@ ed into the ears of children. 
 They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead. 
 What could be more lonely than to be envelop@@ ed in silence, to be the last of your people to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children? 
 And yet, that dread@@ ful fate is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some el@@ der dies and carries with him into the grave the last syl@@ l@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue. 
 And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one langu@@ age@@ ?" And I say, "@@ Gre@@ at, let's make that language Yor@@ ub@@ a. Let's make it Cant@@ on@@ ese. 
 Let's make it Ko@@ gi@@ ." 
 And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language. 
 And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere, a brief journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost. 
 Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "@@ different ways of be@@ ing," I really do mean different ways of being. 
 T@@ ake, for example, this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ thwest Amazon, the people of the an@@ ac@@ ond@@ a who believe that mytho@@ log@@ ically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred sn@@ ak@@ es. 
 Now, this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heav@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend@@ . 
 They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called "@@ linguistic exo@@ gam@@ y@@ :" you must marry someone who speaks a different language. 
 And this is all rooted in the mytho@@ logical past, yet the curious thing is in these long houses, where there are six or seven languages spoken because of inter@@ marriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language. 
 They simply listen and then begin to speak. 
 Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with, the W@@ aor@@ ani of nor@@ theastern Ecuad@@ or, an astonishing people first cont@@ acted peace@@ fully in 195@@ 8. 
 In 1957, five mission@@ aries attempted contact and made a critical mistake. 
 They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly ges@@ tures, for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives. 
 They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure, found nothing, and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the dev@@ il, so they spe@@ ared the five mission@@ aries to death. 
 But the W@@ aor@@ ani didn't just spe@@ ar outsi@@ ders. 
 They spe@@ ared each other. 
 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other. 
 We trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gies back eight generations, and we found two instances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it, they ad@@ mitted that one of the fel@@ lows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we spe@@ ared him anyway. 
 But at the same time they had a per@@ spic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was astonish@@ ing. 
 Their hunters could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ aces and tell you what species left it behind. 
 In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of Du@@ val@@ i@@ er's strength and Ton@@ ton Mac@@ out@@ es, and secur@@ ing the poison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es. 
 In order to make sense out of sens@@ ation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vo@@ d@@ oun@@ . And Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t. 
 On the contr@@ ary, it's a complex metap@@ hys@@ ical world@@ view. 
 It's interesting. 
 If I asked you to name the great religions of the world, what would you say? 
 Christian@@ ity, Islam, Buddhis@@ m, Judais@@ m, whatever. 
 There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious belie@@ fs. Well, of course, they did and Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dis@@ till@@ ation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Di@@ aspor@@ a of the slavery era. 
 But, what makes Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead. 
 So, the living give birth to the spir@@ its. 
 The spir@@ its can be invo@@ ked from beneath the Great Wat@@ er, responding to the rhythm of the dance to moment@@ arily dis@@ place the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the ac@@ oly@@ te becomes the go@@ d. 
 That's why the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that "You white people go to church and speak about God. 
 We dance in the temple and become God." 
 And because you are poss@@ es@@ sed, you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ me@@ d? 
 So you see these astonishing demonstr@@ ation@@ s: Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance handling burning emb@@ ers with imp@@ un@@ ity, a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when cataly@@ zed in the state of extreme excit@@ ation. 
 Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the Ko@@ gi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Mar@@ ta in northern Colombi@@ a. 
 D@@ esc@@ end@@ ants of the ancient T@@ air@@ ona civilization which once car@@ pet@@ ed the Caribbe@@ an coastal plain of Colombi@@ a, in the wake of the con@@ ques@@ t, these people re@@ treated into an isolated volcanic massi@@ f that so@@ ars above the Caribbe@@ an coastal pl@@ ain. 
 In a blood@@ st@@ ained continent, these people alone were never conqu@@ ered by the Span@@ ish. 
 To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary. 
 The young ac@@ oly@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four, seques@@ tered in a shado@@ w@@ y world of darkness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of glaciers for 18 year@@ s: two nine-@@ year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother's w@@ omb@@ ; now they are metaphor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother. 
 And for this entire time, they are in@@ cultur@@ ated into the values of their society, values that maintain the proposition that their pray@@ ers and their pray@@ ers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance. 
 And at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sun@@ rise. And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory. And the pri@@ est steps back and says, "You see? It's really as I've told you. 
 It is that beautiful. It is yours to protec@@ t." 
 They call themselves the "@@ el@@ der brother@@ s" and they say we, who are the younger brother@@ s, are the ones responsible for destroying the world. 
 Now, this level of intuition becomes very important. 
 Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invo@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old canard of the "@@ noble sav@@ age@@ ," which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simplic@@ ity, or altern@@ ativ@@ ely, we invo@@ ke Th@@ or@@ eau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are. 
 Well, indigenous people are neither senti@@ mental nor weak@@ ened by nostal@@ gi@@ a. 
 There's not a lot of room for either in the malari@@ al sw@@ amp@@ s of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ illing winds of Tibet@@ , but they have, nevertheless, through time and ritu@@ al, for@@ ged a traditional mysti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consciously close to it, but on a far subt@@ ler intui@@ tion: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breath@@ ed into being by human consciousness. 
 Now, what does that mean? 
 It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who's raised to believe that that mountain is an A@@ pu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be min@@ ed. 
 Whether it's the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pile of ore is ir@@ relevant. 
 What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world. 
 I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut. 
 That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the K@@ w@@ agi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forests were the abo@@ de of Hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ roo@@ ked Be@@ ak of He@@ av@@ en and the canni@@ bal spir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the north end of the world, spir@@ its they would have to engage during their Ham@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation. 
 Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different real@@ ities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discover@@ ies. Take this plant here. 
 It's a photograph I took in the Nor@@ thwest Amazon just last Apr@@ il. 
 This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psycho@@ active preparation of the sham@@ an's reper@@ toire. 
 What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the sheer pharmac@@ ological potential of this prepar@@ ation, but the elabor@@ ation of it. It's made really of two different sourc@@ es: on the one hand, this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines, har@@ mine, har@@ mal@@ ine, mil@@ dly halluc@@ ino@@ genic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue haz@@ y smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it's mixed with the leaves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the coffee family called Psycho@@ tri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ dis@@ . 
 This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines, very close to brain seroton@@ in, di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine, 5@@ -@@ metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine. 
 If you've ever seen the Y@@ anom@@ ami blowing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine. 
 To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le barrel lined with bar@@ o@@ que paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. 
 It doesn't create the distor@@ tion of real@@ ity; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality. 
 In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psych@@ ed@@ el@@ ic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930@@ s -- I used to argue that you couldn't classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as halluc@@ ino@@ genic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucin@@ ation. 
 But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they're den@@ atu@@ red by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called mono@@ am@@ ine ox@@ id@@ as@@ e. 
 They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ junction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the MA@@ O. 
 Now, the fascinating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are MA@@ O inhibit@@ ors of the precise sort necessary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine. So you ask yourself a question. 
 Ho@@ w, in a fl@@ ora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morpho@@ log@@ ically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the part@@ s? 
 Well, we use that great euph@@ emis@@ m, "@@ trial and err@@ or@@ ," which is exposed to be meaning@@ less. 
 But you ask the Indi@@ ans, and they say, "The plants talk to us." 
 Well, what does that mean? 
 This tribe, the C@@ of@@ an, has 17 varieties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species. 
 And then you ask them how they establish their taxonom@@ y and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants. 
 I mean, don't you know any@@ thing@@ ?" And I said, "No." 
 Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sing@@ s to you in a different key. 
 Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting st@@ amen@@ s. 
 Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pathetic with the p@@ light of indigenous people view them as qu@@ aint and colorful but somehow reduced to the marg@@ ins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on. 
 Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively end@@ ors@@ ed or passi@@ vely accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change. 
 All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life. 
 And the problem is not technology itself. 
 The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and bu@@ gg@@ y. 
 It's not change or technology that threat@@ ens the integrity of the eth@@ no@@ sphere. It is power, the crude face of domin@@ ation. 
 Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destin@@ ed to fade aw@@ ay@@ ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to@@ : whether it's the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous deforest@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the Pen@@ an -- a nom@@ adi@@ c people from Southeast Asia, from Sar@@ aw@@ ak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to serv@@ itude and prostitu@@ tion on the banks of the ri@@ vers, where you can see the river itself is soi@@ led with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of Bor@@ ne@@ o away to the South China Se@@ a, where the Japanese fre@@ igh@@ ters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw log@@ s ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Y@@ anom@@ ami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold. 
 Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet@@ , where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domin@@ ation. 
 You know, genoci@@ de, the physical extinction of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned, but eth@@ noci@@ de, the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned, it's univers@@ ally, in many quar@@ ters, celebrated as part of a development strategy. 
 And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level. 
 I once travel@@ led 6,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ du in Western China over@@ land through sou@@ theastern Tibet to L@@ has@@ a with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to L@@ has@@ a that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6,000 sacred monum@@ ents tor@@ n apart to dust and ash@@ es, 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cul@@ tural Revolution. 
 This young man's father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ anch@@ en Lam@@ a. 
 That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invas@@ i@@ on. 
 His uncle f@@ led with His Hol@@ iness in the Di@@ aspor@@ a that took the people to Nep@@ al. 
 His mother was incarcer@@ ated for the crime of being wealth@@ y. 
 He was smu@@ gg@@ led into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skir@@ t tail@@ s because she couldn't bear to be without him. 
 The sister who had done that brave de@@ ed was put into an education camp. 
 One day she inadver@@ t@@ ently stepped on an arm@@ band of Ma@@ o, and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession, she was given seven years of hard labor. 
 The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the red@@ emp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to be@@ hold. 
 And in the end, then, it really comes down to a cho@@ ice: do we want to live in a mono@@ chrom@@ atic world of mono@@ ton@@ y or do we want to embrace a poly@@ chrom@@ atic world of diversit@@ y? 
 Margaret Me@@ ad, the great anthropolog@@ ist, said, before she died, that her greatest fear was that as we drif@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly amor@@ ph@@ ous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow mod@@ ality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities. 
 And it's hum@@ bling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for [@@ 1@@ 50@@ ,000@@ ] years. 
 The Ne@@ oli@@ thic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture, at which time we succ@@ um@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed; the poetry of the sham@@ an was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od@@ ; we created hierarchy speci@@ alization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago. 
 The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old. 
 Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the en@@ su@@ ing millenni@@ a. 
 When these myri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices. 
 And it's within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flour@@ ish. And there are great moments of optim@@ ism. 
 This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of B@@ aff@@ in Island when I went nar@@ wh@@ al hunting with some Inu@@ it people, and this man, O@@ lay@@ u@@ k, told me a marvelous story of his grand@@ father. 
 The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inu@@ it people, and during the 1950@@ s, to establish our sovereign@@ ty, we forced them into sett@@ lem@@ ents. 
 This old man's grandfather refused to go. 
 The family, fear@@ ful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools. 
 Now, you must understand that the Inu@@ it did not fear the col@@ d; they took advantage of it. 
 The run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were originally made of fish wrapped in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou hi@@ de. 
 So, this man's grandfather was not intimid@@ ated by the Arctic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blow@@ ing. 
 He simply sli@@ pped outside, pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin trou@@ sers and defec@@ ated into his hand. And as the fec@@ es began to freez@@ e, he shaped it into the form of a bl@@ ade. 
 He put a spray of sal@@ iv@@ a on the edge of the sh@@ it knife and as it finally fro@@ ze solid, he but@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it. 
 He skin@@ ned the dog and improvis@@ ed a har@@ ness, took the ri@@ b@@ cage of the dog and improvis@@ ed a sle@@ d, har@@ nessed up an adjacent dog, and disappeared over the ice flo@@ es, sh@@ it knife in bel@@ t. 
 Talk about getting by with nothing. 
 And this, in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inu@@ it people and of all indigenous people around the world. 
 The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inu@@ it an area of land larger than California and Texas put together. 
 It's our new hom@@ el@@ and. It's called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut. 
 It's an independent territ@@ ory. They control all min@@ eral resources. 
 An amazing example of how a nation-@@ state can seek res@@ titu@@ tion with its people. 
 And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all. 
 They're hom@@ el@@ ands of some@@ body. 
 They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geograph@@ y of hope. 
 So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything. 
 We think that po@@ lem@@ ics -- -- we think that po@@ lem@@ ics are not persuas@@ ive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month. 
 15@@ 6 nations carry our television channel. 
 Our magazines are read by millions. 
 And what we're doing is a series of journe@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away d@@ azz@@ led by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore, embrace gradu@@ ally, one by one, the central revel@@ ation of anthropolog@@ y: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicul@@ tur@@ al, plur@@ alistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being. 
 Thank you very much. What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some found@@ ational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Se@@ adr@@ ag@@ on, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remo@@ tely interact with vast amounts of visual data. 
 We're looking at many, many gig@@ abytes of digital photos here and kind of seam@@ lessly and continuously zoom@@ ing in, pan@@ ning through the thing, re@@ arrang@@ ing it in any way we want. 
 And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are. 
 Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congr@@ ess, and it's in the 300 me@@ gap@@ i@@ x@@ el range. 
 It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture. 
 This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-@@ image data. 
 This is "B@@ le@@ ak Hou@@ se@@ " by D@@ ick@@ ens. Every column is a chap@@ ter. 
 To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the tex@@ t; it's not a picture. 
 Maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-@@ book. 
 I wouldn't recommend it. 
 This is a more realistic case. This is an issue of The Guardi@@ an. 
 Every large image is the beginning of a section. 
 And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-@@ scale kind of medium. 
 We've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardi@@ an. 
 We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution -- much higher than you'd be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we've embedded extra content. 
 If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here. 
 Or other models, or even technical specific@@ ations. 
 And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real es@@ tat@@ e. 
 We hope that this means no more pop-@@ ups and other kind of rub@@ b@@ ish like that -- shouldn't be necessary. 
 Of course, mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this. 
 And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. 
 But those are all the roads in the U.S. 
 super@@ imposed on top of a NASA geo@@ spatial image. 
 So let's pull up, now, something else. 
 This is actually live on the Web now@@ ; you can go check it out. 
 This is a project called Photo@@ syn@@ th, which really marries two different technologies. 
 One of them is Se@@ adr@@ ag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by No@@ ah S@@ nav@@ ely, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-@@ advis@@ ed by Steve Se@@ it@@ z at U.@@ W. 
 and Rick S@@ z@@ el@@ is@@ ki at Microsoft Resear@@ ch. A very nice collaboration. 
 And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Se@@ adr@@ ag@@ on. 
 You can see that when we kind of do these sorts of vie@@ ws, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-@@ resolution experience. 
 But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaning@@ ful. 
 The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near G@@ ras@@ si L@@ akes in the Canadian Rock@@ ies -- all these shots were tak@@ en. So you see elements here of stabil@@ ized sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing, and these things have all been related spati@@ ally. 
 I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. 
 There are some that are much more spatial. 
 I would like to jump straight to one of No@@ ah@@ 's original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what I think is really the pun@@ ch line behind this technology, the Photo@@ syn@@ th technology. And it's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we've put up on the website. 
 We had to worry about the lawyers and so on. 
 This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Ca@@ thedr@@ al that was done entirely comput@@ ation@@ ally from images scrap@@ ed from Flick@@ r. You just type Notre Dame into Flick@@ r, and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts, and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. 
 And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spati@@ ally in this way. 
 And we can just navigate in this very simple way. 
 You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsof@@ t. 
 It's very grati@@ fying to have this kind of recep@@ tion here. 
 I guess you can see this is lots of different types of camer@@ as@@ : it's everything from cell phone cameras to professional S@@ L@@ R@@ s, quite a large number of them, stit@@ ched together in this environment. 
 And if I can, I'll find some of the sort of weird ones. 
 So many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces, and so on. 
 Some@@ where in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go. 
 This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correc@@ tly. 
 We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment. 
 What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of, visu@@ ally, of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together. 
 All of those photos become linked together, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. 
 You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. 
 Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Law@@ ler's Virtual Earth work. 
 And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. 
 Their own photos are getting tagged with met@@ a-@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed. 
 If somebody bothered to tag all of these sain@@ ts and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Ca@@ thedr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ ri@@ ched with all of that data, and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, into that met@@ a-@@ ver@@ se, using everybody else's photos, and do a kind of a cross-@@ mod@@ al and cross-@@ user social experience that way. 
 And of course, a by-@@ product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from over@@ head flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Do I understand this right? That what your software is going to al@@ low, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together? 
 Yes. What this is really doing is discover@@ ing. 
 It's creating hyper@@ lin@@ ks, if you will, between images. 
 And it's doing that based on the content inside the images. 
 And that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the sem@@ antic information that a lot of those images have. 
 Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phras@@ es, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. 
 Now, what if that picture links to all of your pictu@@ res? 
 Then the amount of sem@@ antic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect. 
 Bl@@ aise, that is truly incredible. Congr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations. 
 Thanks so much. I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will reson@@ ate with other things you've already heard, and I'll try to make some connections myself, in case you miss them. 
 I want to start with what I call the "@@ official dog@@ ma@@ ." 
 The official dog@@ ma of what? 
 The official dog@@ ma of all western industrial societies. 
 And the official dog@@ ma runs like this: if we are interested in maxim@@ izing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maxim@@ ize individual freedom. 
 The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good, valu@@ able, worth@@ while, essential to being human. 
 And because if people have freedom, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim@@ ize our wel@@ f@@ are, and no one has to decide on our be@@ half. 
 The way to maxim@@ ize freedom is to maxim@@ ize choice. 
 The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more welfare they have. 
 This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it. 
 And it's also deeply embedded in our lives. 
 I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us. 
 This is my super@@ market. Not such a big one. 
 I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dress@@ ing. 
 175 sal@@ ad dress@@ ings in my super@@ market, if you don't count the 10 extra-@@ virg@@ in olive o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic v@@ ine@@ gars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dress@@ ings, in the off-@@ chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you. 
 So this is what the supermarket is like. 
 And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stere@@ o system -- speakers, CD play@@ er, tape play@@ er, tun@@ er, ampli@@ fier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store, there are that many stere@@ o systems. 
 We can construct six@@ -and-@@ a-@@ half-@@ million different stere@@ o systems out of the components that are on offer in one store. 
 You've got to admit that's a lot of choice. 
 In other dom@@ ains -- the world of communic@@ ations. 
 There was a time, when I was a boy, when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted, as long as it came from Ma B@@ ell. 
 You rented your phone. You didn't buy it. 
 One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never bro@@ ke. 
 And those days are gone. 
 We now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones. 
 These are cell phones of the future. 
 My favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 play@@ er, nose hair tr@@ imm@@ er, and cre@@ me bru@@ le@@ e tor@@ ch. 
 And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet, you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will. 
 And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question. 
 And do you know what the answer to this question now is? 
 The answer is "No." 
 It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much. 
 So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true. 
 Health care -- it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do. 
 Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B. 
 A has these benefits, and these risks. 
 B has these benefits, and these risks. What do you want to do?" 
 And you say, "D@@ oc@@ , what should I do?" 
 And the do@@ c says, "A has these benefits and ris@@ ks, and B has these benefits and risks. 
 What do you want to do?" 
 And you say, "If you were me, Doc@@ , what would you do?" 
 And the do@@ c says, "But I'm not you." 
 And the result is -- we call it "@@ patient autonom@@ y," which makes it sound like a good thing, but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely, the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely, the patient. 
 There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me, which, if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them. 
 Why do they market to us if we can't buy them? 
 The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescri@@ ptions to be changed. 
 Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide is meant to indic@@ ate. 
 We don't inher@@ it an identi@@ ty; we get to invent it. 
 And we get to re-@@ invent ourselves as often as we like. 
 And that means that every@@ day, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. 
 With respect to marriage and family, there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could, and then you started having kids as soon as you could. 
 The only real choice was who, not when, and not what you did after. 
 Now@@ ad@@ ays, everything is very much up for grab@@ s. 
 I teach wonderfully intelligent students, and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to. 
 And it's not because they're less smart, and it's not because they're less dil@@ ig@@ ent. 
 It's because they are pre@@ occu@@ pied, asking themselves, "@@ Should I get married or not? Should I get married now? 
 Should I get married lat@@ er? Should I have kids first, or a career first@@ ?" 
 All of these are consuming questions. 
 And they're going to answer these questions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses. 
 And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer. 
 Wor@@ k -- we are bles@@ sed, as Carl was pointing out, with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the Rand@@ ol@@ ph Ho@@ tel. 
 There is one corner, by the way, that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the Wi@@ F@@ i works. 
 I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it. 
 So what this means, this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work, is that we have to make a decision, again and again and again, about whether we should or shouldn't be working. 
 We can go to watch our kid play soc@@ c@@ er, and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p, and our Blackber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p, and our laptop, presum@@ ably, on our lap@@ s. 
 And even if they're all shut off, every minute that we're watching our kid mutil@@ ate a soccer game, we are also asking ourselves, "@@ Should I answer this cell phone call@@ ? 
 Should I respond to this em@@ ail@@ ? Should I draf@@ t this let@@ ter@@ ?" 
 And even if the answer to the question is "no@@ ," it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid@@ 's soccer game very different than it woul@@ d've been. 
 So everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things, life is a matter of choice. 
 And the world we used to live in looked like this. 
 That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice. 
 And the world we now live in looks like this. 
 And the question is, is this good news, or bad new@@ s? 
 And the answer is yes. 
 We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. 
 All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people. 
 One effect, paradox@@ ically, is that it produces paralys@@ is, rather than liber@@ ation. 
 With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all. 
 I'll give you one very dramatic example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. 
 A colleague of mine got access to investment records from V@@ angu@@ ard, the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places. 
 And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offer@@ ed, rate of participation went down two percent. 
 You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why? 
 Because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow. 
 And then tomorrow, and then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and of course tomorrow never comes. 
 Under@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employ@@ er. 
 By not particip@@ ating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employ@@ er, who would happily match their contribu@@ tion. 
 So paraly@@ sis is a consequence of having too many choices. 
 And I think it makes the world look like this. 
 You really want to get the decision right if it's for all etern@@ ity, right? 
 You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fun@@ d, or even the wrong sal@@ ad dress@@ ing. 
 So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paraly@@ sis and make a choice, we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. 
 And there are several reasons for this. 
 One of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dress@@ ings to choose from, if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and, you know, what sal@@ ad dressing is? -- it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imagined alternative indu@@ ces you to regret the decision you made, and this regret sub@@ trac@@ ts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made, even if it was a good decision. 
 The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disap@@ pointing about the option that you chose. 
 Second, what economists call "@@ opportunity cost@@ s." 
 Dan Gil@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to. 
 Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consi@@ der, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you rejec@@ t, that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you've cho@@ sen@@ . 
 Here's an example. For those of you who aren't New York@@ ers, I apologi@@ ze. 
 But here's what you're supposed to be thinking. 
 Here's this couple on the Hamp@@ tons. 
 Very expensive real es@@ tat@@ e. 
 Gor@@ ge@@ ous beach. Beauti@@ ful day. They have it all to themselves. 
 What could be better? "Well, damn it@@ ," this guy is thinking, "It's Augu@@ st. 
 Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away. 
 I could be parking right in front of my build@@ ing." 
 And he spends two weeks nag@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space. 
 Op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity costs sub@@ tr@@ act from the satisfaction we get out of what we choo@@ se, even when what we choose is terrific@@ . 
 And the more options there are to consi@@ der, the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs. 
 Here's another example. 
 Now this cartoon makes a lot of points. 
 It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slowly. 
 But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing, you're choosing not to do other things. 
 And those other things may have lots of attractive fe@@ atures, and it's going to make what you're doing less attr@@ active. 
 Thir@@ d: escal@@ ation of expect@@ ations. 
 This hit me when I went to replace my je@@ ans. 
 I wear jeans almost all the time. 
 And there was a time when jeans came in one flav@@ or, and you bought them, and they fit like cr@@ ap, and they were incredibly un@@ comfortable, and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times, they started to feel OK. 
 So I went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones, and I said, you know, "I want a pair of je@@ ans. Here's my siz@@ e." 
 And the shop@@ kee@@ per said, "Do you want sli@@ m fit, easy fit, relax@@ ed f@@ it? 
 You want button fly or z@@ ip@@ per fl@@ y? You want ston@@ e@@ washed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ was@@ he@@ d? 
 Do you want them distr@@ esse@@ d? 
 You want boot cut, you want tap@@ ered, bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah ..." On and on he w@@ ent. 
 My jaw drop@@ ped, and after I recover@@ ed, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kin@@ d." 
 He had no idea what that was, so I spent an hour trying on all these damn je@@ ans, and I walked out of the store -- truth@@ ! -- with the best-@@ fitting jeans I had ever had. 
 I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better. 
 But I felt worse. 
 Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. 
 The reason I felt worse is that, with all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up. 
 I had very low -- I had no particular expectations when they only came in one flav@@ or. 
 When they came in 100 flav@@ ors, damn it, one of them shoul@@ d've been perfect. 
 And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect. 
 And so I compared what I got to what I expec@@ ted, and what I got was disap@@ pointing in comparison to what I expec@@ ted. 
 Ad@@ ding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be. 
 And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results, even when they're good results. 
 Nobody in the world of marketing knows this, because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about. 
 The truth is more like this. 
 The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. 
 Now@@ ad@@ ays, the world we live in -- we afflu@@ ent, industrialized citizens, with perfec@@ tion the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. 
 You will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expect@@ ations, my expect@@ ations, have gone through the roof. 
 The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expect@@ ations. 
 I want to say -- just a little autobio@@ graph@@ ical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife, and she's really quite wonderful. 
 I couldn't have done better. I didn't sett@@ le. 
 But sett@@ ling isn't always such a bad thing. 
 Finally, one consequence of buying a bad@@ -@@ fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied, and you ask why, who's responsi@@ ble, the answer is clear@@ : the world is responsi@@ ble. What could you do? 
 When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available, and you buy one that is disap@@ poin@@ ting, and you ask why, who's responsi@@ ble? 
 It is equally clear that the answer to the question is you. 
 You could have done better. 
 With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display, there is no excuse for failure. 
 And so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disap@@ pointed about them; they blame themselves. 
 Clin@@ ical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. 
 I believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide, is that people have experiences that are disap@@ pointing because their standards are so high, and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at faul@@ t. 
 And so the net result is that we do better in general, objec@@ tively, and we feel worse. 
 So let me remind you. 
 This is the official dog@@ ma, the one that we all take to be true, and it's all fal@@ se. It is not true. 
 There's no question that some choice is better than non@@ e, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. 
 There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is. 
 I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our wel@@ f@@ are. 
 Now, as a policy matter -- I'm almost done -- as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material afflu@@ ence. 
 There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice. 
 Their problem is that they have too little. 
 So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, afflu@@ ent, Western societies. 
 And what is so frustrating and in@@ furi@@ ating is this: Steve L@@ evit@@ t talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficul@@ t-to-@@ install child seats don't help. It's a waste of money. 
 What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices -- it's not simply that they don't help. 
 They actually hur@@ t. 
 They actually make us worse off. 
 If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options, not only would those people's lives be impro@@ ved, but ours would be improved also. 
 This is what economists call a "Par@@ et@@ o-@@ improving mo@@ ve." 
 In@@ come re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice pl@@ ag@@ ues us. 
 So to conclu@@ de. You're supposed to read this carto@@ on, and, being a sophisticated person, say, "A@@ h! What does this fish know? 
 You know, nothing is possible in this fish@@ bow@@ l@@ ." 
 Im@@ pover@@ ished imagination, a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that's the way I read it at first. 
 The more I thought about it, however, the more I came to the view that this fish knows something. 
 Because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the fish@@ bowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom. You have paralys@@ is. 
 If you sh@@ at@@ ter this fish@@ bowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfac@@ tion. 
 You increase paralys@@ is, and you decrease satisfac@@ tion. 
 Everybody needs a fish@@ bow@@ l. 
 This one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us. 
 But the absence of some metaphorical fish@@ bowl is a recipe for miser@@ y, and, I suspec@@ t, disaster. 
 Thank you very much. You know, I've talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean, and discovering new sets of genes. 
 We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digiti@@ zing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthes@@ izing life. 
 So, we've always been trying to ask big questions. 
 "What is life@@ ?" is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels. 
 We've tried various approach@@ es, par@@ ing it down to minimal components. 
 We've been digiti@@ zing it now for almost 20 year@@ s; when we sequenced the human genome, it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer. 
 Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital univer@@ se@@ ?" 
 This is the map of a small organism, My@@ co@@ plasma gen@@ itali@@ um, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-@@ replicate in the laboratory, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome. 
 We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here. 
 When we look at its metabolic map, it's relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me, this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time, it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell. 
 So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions. 
 And so we started down the road of@@ : can we synthesize a chromo@@ some@@ ? 
 Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before? 
 And if we do, can we boot up a chromo@@ some@@ ? 
 A chromosom@@ e, by the way, is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material. 
 So, our pace of digiti@@ zing life has been increasing at an exponential p@@ ace. 
 Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increas@@ ing, and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve. 
 We started this over 15 years ago. 
 It took several st@@ ages, in fact, starting with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments. 
 But it turns out synthes@@ izing DNA is very difficult. 
 There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it's a de@@ generate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are. 
 So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the err@@ ors. 
 And this was our first attemp@@ t, starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i X@@ 17@@ 4. 
 It's a small virus that kills bacteria. 
 We designed the pieces, went through our error correc@@ tion and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 let@@ ters. 
 The exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, made the viral particles. 
 The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli. 
 I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model. 
 They laughed more than you guys are. 
 And so, we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system. 
 But we wanted to go much larg@@ er: we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it's over 5@@ 80,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we'd build them in casset@@ tes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the casset@@ tes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are. 
 Design is critic@@ al, and if you're starting with digital information in the computer, that digital information has to be really accur@@ ate. 
 When we first sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of accur@@ acy was one error per 10,000 base p@@ airs. 
 We actually found, on res@@ equ@@ enc@@ ing it, 30 err@@ ors@@ ; had we used that original sequ@@ ence, it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up. 
 Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ lap with all the other 50-@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ units we have to design so they can go together. 
 We design unique elements into this. 
 You may have read that we put water@@ marks in. 
 Think of this: we have a four-@@ letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T. 
 Tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids, such that there's a single letter design@@ ation for each of the amino ac@@ ids. 
 So we can use the genetic code to write out words, sent@@ ences, thoughts. 
 Initi@@ ally, all we did was auto@@ graph it. 
 Some people were disap@@ pointed there was not poe@@ try. 
 We designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enzy@@ mes@@ ; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together. 
 And we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters, put those together to make 24@@ ,000-@@ letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000. 
 At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute. 
 We're trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation. 
 So, this looks like a basketball play@@ off. 
 When we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs, they won't any longer grow read@@ ily in E. coli -- it exhau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms. 
 We knew there's a mechanism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together. 
 Here's an example of it: there's an organism called De@@ ino@@ coccus radio@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions r@@ ads of radiation. 
 You can see in the top pan@@ el, its chromosome just gets blown apart. 
 Tw@@ el@@ ve to 24 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before. 
 We have thousands of organisms that can do this. 
 These organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cat@@ ed; they can live in a vacuum. 
 I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space, move around, find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment. 
 In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there. 
 Here's an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these process@@ es, actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in@@ ; yeast puts them together automatic@@ ally. 
 This is not an electron micro@@ graph@@ ; this is just a regular pho@@ tom@@ icro@@ graph. 
 It's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope. 
 These are pictures over about a six-@@ second period. 
 So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago. 
 This is over 5@@ 80,000 letters of genetic co@@ de@@ ; it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure. 
 It's over 300 million molecular weight. 
 If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spac@@ ing, it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code. 
 Well, how do we boot up a chromo@@ some@@ ? How do we activate this? 
 Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simp@@ le; it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria. 
 It's also simpler when you go into eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes like ourselv@@ es: you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with clon@@ ing. 
 With bacteria and Ar@@ chae@@ a, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. 
 We puri@@ fied a chromosome from one microbial species -- rough@@ ly, these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosom@@ e, we diges@@ ted it with enzymes to kill all the prote@@ ins, and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here. 
 The new chromosome went into the cell. 
 In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went, but we tried to design the process a little bit further. 
 This is a major mechanism of evolution right here. 
 We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere, adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species. 
 So, people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology. 
 There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually dig@@ est DNA. 
 The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one; the chromosome we put in does. 
 It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material, che@@ wed it up, and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome. 
 It turned blue because of the genes we put in it. 
 And with a very short period of time, all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell. 
 All the proteins changed, the membranes chang@@ ed; when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in. 
 So, this may sound like genomic al@@ chem@@ y, but we can, by moving the software of DNA around, change things quite dramatic@@ ally. 
 Now I've argu@@ ed, this is not gen@@ es@@ is; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. 
 And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambri@@ an explo@@ sion, where there's massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design. 
 Why do this? 
 I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs. 
 We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years. 
 To put it in context for my@@ self: I was born in 194@@ 6. 
 There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 194@@ 6@@ ; within 40 years, there'll be four. 
 We have trouble feed@@ ing, providing fres@@ h, clean water, medic@@ ines, fuel for the six and a half billion. 
 It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine. 
 We use over five billion tons of coal, 30 billion-@@ plus barrels of oil -- that's a hundred million barrels a day. 
 When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that, it's going to be a huge challenge. 
 Then of course, there's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere. 
 We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future. 
 The electronics industry only had a dozen or so compon@@ ents, and look at the diversity that came out of that. 
 We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination. 
 We now have techniques, because of these rapid methods of synthes@@ is, to do what we're calling combin@@ at@@ orial genom@@ ics. 
 We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day. 
 When you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce pharmaceutic@@ als, new vacc@@ ines, we can just with a small team, do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science. 
 And it's just standard selec@@ tion: we can select for vi@@ ability, chemical or fuel production, vaccine production, etc. 
 This is a screen snap@@ shot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer. 
 You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look lik@@ e: we know exactly what their genetic code looks like. 
 We're focusing on now four@@ th-@@ generation fuels. 
 You've seen recently, corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment. 
 We have second@@ - and third-@@ generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar, to much high@@ er-@@ value fuels like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol. 
 But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with CO2 as its feed@@ stoc@@ k, and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road. 
 And we think we'll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fuels in about 18 months. 
 Sun@@ light and CO2 is one method ... 
 but in our discovery around the world, we have all kinds of other metho@@ ds. 
 This is an organism we described in 199@@ 6. 
 It lives in the deep ocean, about a mile and a half deep, almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temper@@ atures. 
 It takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source. 
 We're looking to see if we can take captured CO2, which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites, convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process. 
 So, in a short period of time, we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of "What is life@@ ?" 
 We tr@@ uly, you know, have modest goals of replacing the whole pe@@ trol@@ -@@ chemical industry -- Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? -- become a major source of energy ... 
 But also, we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vacc@@ ines. 
 You've seen this year with flu@@ ; we're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vacc@@ ine. 
 I think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ orial vaccines in adv@@ ance. 
 Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing, now, the evolutionary tree, speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria, Ar@@ chae@@ a and, eventually, eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes. 
 We're a ways away from improving people@@ : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much. Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LH@@ C. 
 And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked. 
 So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there, the LH@@ C is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circum@@ fer@@ ence. 
 Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billion@@ th of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second. 
 It's nothing if not ambiti@@ ous. 
 This is the machine below Gen@@ ev@@ a. 
 We take the pictures of those mini-@@ Big Bang@@ s inside detec@@ tors. 
 This is the one I work on. It's called the AT@@ L@@ AS detector -- 44 meters wide, 22 meters in diam@@ eter. 
 Spec@@ tac@@ ular picture here of AT@@ L@@ AS under construction so you can see the scale. 
 On the 10@@ th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time. 
 And this picture was taken by AT@@ L@@ AS. 
 It caused immense celebration in the control room. 
 It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LH@@ C, colli@@ ding with a piece of the LH@@ C deliber@@ ately, and show@@ ering particles into the detec@@ tor. 
 In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10@@ th we knew the machine worked, which is a great trium@@ ph@@ . 
 I don't know whether this got the biggest che@@ er, or this, when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that. 
 It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact. 
 About a week later we had a problem with the machine, related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold w@@ ires. 
 Those wires carry 13 thousand amp@@ s when the machine is working in full power. 
 Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say, "No they don't. They're small w@@ ir@@ es." 
 They can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called super@@ conducting wire. 
 So at minus 27@@ 1 degrees, col@@ der than the space between the stars, those wires can take that curr@@ ent. 
 In one of the join@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 magn@@ ets in LH@@ C, there was a manufacturing defec@@ t. 
 So the wire heated up sligh@@ tly, and its 1@@ 3,000 amp@@ s suddenly encountered electrical resistance. 
 This was the result. 
 Now that's more impressive when you consider those magn@@ ets weigh over 20 tons, and they moved about a foot. 
 So we damaged about 50 of the mag@@ nets. 
 We had to take them out, which we did. 
 We re@@ condition@@ ed them all, fixed them. 
 They're all on their way back underground now. 
 By the end of March the LH@@ C will be intact again. 
 We will switch it on, and we expect to take data in June or J@@ uly, and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are. 
 Now of course, in a way those accidents re@@ ign@@ ite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refu@@ te. 
 I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're over@@ reach@@ ing, is the value of things like the LH@@ C. 
 I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Hum@@ ph@@ rey D@@ av@@ y, who, I suspec@@ t, when def@@ ending his prote@@ g@@ e's useless experiments -- his prote@@ ge was Michael Far@@ ad@@ ay -- said this, "@@ Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultim@@ ate, that there are no mysteries in nature, that our trium@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te, and that there are no new worlds to conqu@@ er." 
 Thank you. I am a writ@@ er. 
 Wr@@ iting books is my profession but it's more than that, of course. 
 It is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation. 
 And I don't expect that that's ever going to change. 
 But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career, which has caused me to have to re@@ calibr@@ ate my whole relationship with this work. 
 And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this mem@@ oir called "E@@ at, Pr@@ ay, Lo@@ ve" which, decide@@ dly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason, and became this big, mega-@@ sens@@ ation, international bes@@ t@@ sell@@ er thing. 
 The result of which is that everywhere I go now, people treat me like I'm do@@ om@@ ed. 
 Seri@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed, do@@ om@@ ed@@ ! 
 Like, they come up to me now, all worri@@ ed, and they say, "A@@ ren@@ 't you afraid -- aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that? 
 A@@ ren@@ 't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all, ever again@@ ?" 
 So that's reas@@ sur@@ ing, you know. 
 But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I first started telling people -- when I was a teen@@ ager -- that I wanted to be a writer, I was met with this same kind of, sort of fear@@ -based re@@ action. 
 And people would say, "A@@ ren@@ 't you afraid you're never going to have any success@@ ? 
 A@@ ren@@ 't you afraid the humili@@ ation of rejec@@ tion will kill you? 
 A@@ ren@@ 't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and no@@ thing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scr@@ ap he@@ ap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter ash of failu@@ re?" 
 Like that, you know. 
 The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes." 
 Yes, I'm afraid of all those things. 
 And I always have been. 
 And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides that people can't even guess at. 
 Like sea@@ we@@ ed, and other things that are scary. 
 But, when it comes to writing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lat@@ ely, and wondering about lat@@ ely, is why? 
 You know, is it ration@@ al? 
 Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do. 
 You know, and what is it specifically about creative vent@@ ures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don't do, you know? 
 Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know? 
 It didn't -- that chemical engineering block John, how@@ 's it going? 
 It just didn't come up like that, you know? 
 But to be fai@@ r, chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ depres@@ si@@ ves. 
 We writ@@ ers, we kind of do have that re@@ put@@ ation, and not just writ@@ ers, but creative people across all gen@@ res, it seem@@ s, have this reputation for being enormously mentally un@@ stable. 
 And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands, you know? 
 And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really un@@ done by their gif@@ ts, you know. 
 Norman M@@ ail@@ er, just before he died, last interview, he said "@@ Every one of my books has killed me a little mor@@ e." 
 An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work, you know. 
 But we don't even bl@@ ink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely intern@@ alized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that arti@@ str@@ y, in the end, will always ultimately lead to angu@@ ish. 
 And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that ide@@ a? 
 Are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know -- I'm not at all comfortable with that assum@@ ption. 
 I think it's o@@ di@@ ous. 
 And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it perpetu@@ ated into the next century. 
 I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live. 
 And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of le@@ aking down that dark path of assum@@ ption, particularly given the circumst@@ ance that I'm in right now in my career. 
 Which is -- you know, like check it out, I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old. 
 I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me. 
 And it's exce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judg@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book, right? 
 I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's exce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. 
 Oh, so Jes@@ us, what a though@@ t! 
 You know that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to go there. 
 I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love. 
 And so, the question be@@ comes, how@@ ? 
 And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflec@@ tion, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing, is that I have to create some sort of protec@@ tive psychological construc@@ t, right? 
 I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on. 
 And, as I've been looking over the last year for models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people, sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity. 
 And that search has led me to ancient Gree@@ ce and ancient Rome. 
 So stay with me, because it does circle around and back. 
 But, ancient Gree@@ ce and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then, O.@@ K@@ .@@ ? 
 People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and un@@ know@@ able source, for distant and un@@ know@@ able reasons. 
 The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spir@@ its of creativity "@@ da@@ em@@ ons." 
 So@@ cr@@ ates, fam@@ ously, believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar. 
 The Rom@@ ans had the same idea, but they called that sort of dis@@ embodied creative spirit a geni@@ us. 
 Which is great, because the Rom@@ ans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual. 
 They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine enti@@ ty, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist@@ 's studio, kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the house el@@ f, and who would come out and sort of invisi@@ bly ass@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work. 
 So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work. 
 And everyone knew that this is how it function@@ ed, right? 
 So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much narciss@@ ism, right? 
 If your work was brilliant you couldn't take all the credit for it, everybody knew that you had this dis@@ embodied genius who had helped you. 
 If your work bom@@ bed, not entirely your faul@@ t, you know? 
 Everyone knew your genius was kind of lam@@ e. 
 And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time. 
 And then the Ren@@ aissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteri@@ es, and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dic@@ tation from the div@@ ine. 
 And it's the beginning of rational human@@ ism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual. 
 And for the first time in history, you start to hear people refer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a geni@@ us. 
 And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error. 
 You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vess@@ el, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all div@@ ine, creative, un@@ know@@ able, eternal mystery is just a smi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psy@@ che. 
 It's like asking somebody to swal@@ low the sun. 
 It just completely war@@ ps and distor@@ ts ego@@ s, and it creates all these un@@ man@@ age@@ able expectations about performance. 
 And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years. 
 And, if this is true, and I think it is true, the question be@@ comes, what now? 
 Can we do this differ@@ ent@@ ly? 
 Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative myst@@ ery. 
 Maybe not. 
 Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational human@@ istic thought in one 18 minute speech. 
 And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspici@@ ons about the notion of, basically fai@@ ries who follow people around rub@@ bing fai@@ ry juice on their projects and stuff. 
 I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this. 
 But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why not? 
 Why not think about it this way? 
 Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter ma@@ dd@@ ening capr@@ ici@@ ous@@ ness of the creative process. 
 A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave ration@@ ally. 
 And, in fact, can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ anor@@ mal. 
 I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ru@@ th St@@ one, who's now in her 9@@ 0s, but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virgini@@ a, she would be out working in the fields, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape. 
 And she said it was like a thunder@@ ous train of air. 
 And it would come barrel@@ ing down at her over the landscape. 
 And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet. 
 She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, "@@ run like h@@ ell@@ ." 
 And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chas@@ ed by this po@@ em, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thunder@@ ed through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page. 
 And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and running and run@@ ning, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking, as she put it "@@ for another po@@ et." 
 And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right? 
 So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her, and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it. 
 She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcri@@ bing on the page. 
 And in these inst@@ ances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwar@@ ds, from the last word to the first. 
 So when I heard that I was like -- that's un@@ can@@ ny, that's exactly what my creative process is like. 
 That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipel@@ ine@@ ! 
 I'm a mu@@ le, and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awk@@ ward@@ ly. 
 But even I, in my mul@@ ish@@ ness, even I have br@@ ushed up against that thing, at times. 
 And I would imagine that a lot of you have too. 
 You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identi@@ f@@ y. 
 And what is that thing? 
 And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us san@@ e? 
 And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom W@@ ai@@ ts, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assign@@ ment. 
 And we were talking about this, and you know, T@@ om, for most of his life he was pretty much the embodi@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of un@@ control@@ l@@ able creative impul@@ ses that were totally intern@@ alized. 
 But then he got older, he got cal@@ mer, and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in Los Angeles he told me, and this is when it all changed for him. 
 And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of mel@@ ody, that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elu@@ sive and tant@@ aliz@@ ing, and he wants it, you know, it's gorge@@ ous, and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it. 
 He doesn't have a piece of paper, he doesn't have a penc@@ il, he doesn't have a tape recor@@ der. 
 So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and then I'm going to be haun@@ ted by this song forever. 
 I'm not good enough, and I can't do it." 
 And instead of pan@@ ick@@ ing, he just stop@@ ped. 
 He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely nov@@ el. 
 He just looked up at the sky, and he said, "@@ Excuse me, can you not see that I'm dri@@ ving@@ ?" 
 "Do I look like I can write down a song right now? 
 If you really want to exist, come back at a more op@@ port@@ une moment when I can take care of you. 
 Other@@ wise, go bother somebody else today. 
 Go bother Leonard Co@@ hen@@ ." 
 And his whole work process changed after that. 
 Not the work, the work was still often@@ times as dark as ever. 
 But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the gen@@ ie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it kind of back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this intern@@ alized, tor@@ ment@@ ed thing. 
 It could be this peculi@@ ar, won@@ d@@ rou@@ s, bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite T@@ om. 
 So when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and it already saved me once. 
 This idea, it saved me when I was in the middle of writing "E@@ at, Pr@@ ay, Lo@@ ve@@ ," and I fell into one of those, sort of p@@ its of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, this is going to be the worst book ever writ@@ ten. 
 Not just bad, but the worst book ever writ@@ ten. 
 And I started to think I should just dump this project. 
 But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it. 
 So I just lifted my face up from the manus@@ cri@@ pt and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room. 
 And I said alou@@ d, "L@@ ist@@ en you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my faul@@ t, right? 
 Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this. 
 So if you want it to be better, then you've got to show up and do your part of the deal. 
 O.@@ K. But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it. 
 I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job. 
 And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job@@ ." 
 Because -- in the end it's like this, O.@@ K. -- centuries ago in the deser@@ ts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moon@@ light d@@ ances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until daw@@ n. 
 And they were always magnific@@ ent, because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific@@ , right? 
 But every once in a while, very rar@@ ely, something would happen, and one of these perform@@ ers would actually become transcend@@ ent. 
 And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this. 
 It was like time would stop, and the danc@@ er would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align@@ . 
 And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human. 
 He would be lit from within@@ , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divin@@ ity. 
 And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name. 
 They would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant, "Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, God, God, God." 
 That's God, you know. 
 Curi@@ ous historical foot@@ note -- when the Mo@@ ors invaded southern Sp@@ ain, they took this custom with them and the pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the centuries from "Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h@@ ," to "O@@ le, o@@ le, o@@ le@@ ," which you still hear in bull@@ figh@@ ts and in flam@@ enc@@ o d@@ ances. 
 In Sp@@ ain, when a per@@ former has done something impossible and magic, "Al@@ la@@ h, o@@ le, o@@ le, Al@@ la@@ h, magnific@@ ent, br@@ avo@@ ," in@@ comprehen@@ si@@ ble, there it is -- a glimpse of God. 
 Which is great, because we need that. 
 But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the danc@@ er himself, when he w@@ akes up and dis@@ covers that it's Tuesday at 11 a.@@ m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God. 
 He's just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad kne@@ es, and maybe he's never going to asc@@ end to that height again. 
 And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he sp@@ ins, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life? 
 This is hard. 
 This is one of the most painful reconcili@@ ations to make in a creative life. 
 But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of angu@@ ish if you never happened to believe, in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you. 
 But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some un@@ imaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else. 
 And, you know, if we think about it this way it starts to change everything. 
 This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published, as the danger@@ ously, frighten@@ ingly over-@@ anticip@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success. 
 And what I have to, sort of keep telling myself when I get really psy@@ ched out about that, is, don't be afrai@@ d. 
 Don't be daun@@ ted. 
 Just do your job. 
 Contin@@ ue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be. 
 If your job is to dance, do your dance. 
 If the div@@ ine, cock@@ eyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be glim@@ p@@ sed, for just one moment through your efforts, then "O@@ le@@ !" 
 And if not, do your dance any@@ how. 
 And "O@@ le@@ !" to you, noneth@@ eless. 
 I believe this and I feel that we must teach it. 
 "O@@ le@@ !" to you, noneth@@ eless, just for having the sheer human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 O@@ le@@ ! Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states, has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent. 
 But this underst@@ ates the serious@@ ness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thick@@ ness of the ice. 
 The arc@@ tic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system. 
 It exp@@ ands in winter and contr@@ acts in summer. 
 The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-@@ forward of what's happened over the last 25 years. 
 The permanent ice is marked in red. 
 As you see, it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that's the annual ice in winter, and it contr@@ acts in summer. 
 The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older, you can see is almost like blood, sp@@ illing out of the body here. 
 In 25 years it's gone from this, to this. 
 This is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Oce@@ an, where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which, when it th@@ aws, is turned into methane by microbes. 
 Compar@@ ed to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. 
 Al@@ ready in some shallow la@@ kes in Alask@@ a, methane is actively bub@@ bling up out of the water. 
 Professor K@@ at@@ ey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter. 
 Who@@ a! 
 She's okay. The question is whether we will be. 
 And one reason is, this enormous heat sink he@@ ats up Greenland from the north. 
 This is an annual melting river. 
 But the volumes are much larger than ever. 
 This is the K@@ ang@@ er@@ lus@@ su@@ a@@ q River in sou@@ thwest Green@@ land. 
 If you want to know how sea level rises from land@@ -@@ base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea. 
 These flows are increasing very rapid@@ ly. 
 At the other end of the planet, Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet. 
 Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance. 
 And west Antarctica cro@@ pped up on top some under-@@ sea is@@ lands, is particularly rapid in its mel@@ ting. 
 That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Green@@ land. 
 In the Himalay@@ as, the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new la@@ kes, which a few years ago were glaci@@ ers. 
 40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow. 
 In the An@@ des, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city. 
 The flows have increas@@ ed. 
 But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water. 
 In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snow@@ pac@@ k. 
 This is hitting the reser@@ vo@@ irs. 
 And the predic@@ tions, as you've read, are serious. 
 This dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fir@@ es. 
 And the disas@@ ters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate. 
 Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 7@@ 5. 
 This is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern. 
 If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing. 
 In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans. 
 Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific, from the Americ@@ as, extending w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard, and on either side of the Indian sub@@ continent, where there is a radical deple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans. 
 The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforest@@ ation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels. 
 O@@ il is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem. 
 The United States is one of the two largest emit@@ ters, along with China. 
 And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. 
 But we're beginning to see a sea change. 
 Here are the ones that have been can@@ cel@@ led in the last few years with some green alternatives propo@@ sed. 
 Ho@@ wever there is a political battle in our country. 
 And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calend@@ ar year promoting clean coal, which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on. 
 That image reminded me of something. 
 Around Christ@@ mas, in my home in Tennes@@ see, a billion gallons of coal slu@@ dge was sp@@ il@@ led. 
 You probably saw it on the news. 
 This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America. 
 This happened around Christ@@ mas@@ . 
 One of the coal industr@@ y's ads around Christmas was this one. 
 Fro@@ sty the coal man is a jol@@ ly, happy soul. 
 He's abundant here in America, and he helps our economy grow. 
 Fro@@ sty the coal man is getting clean@@ er everyday. 
 He's affordable and ador@@ able, and workers keep their p@@ ay. 
 This is the source of much of the coal in West Virgini@@ a. 
 The largest mountain@@ top min@@ er is the head of M@@ asse@@ y Co@@ al. 
 Let me be clear about it. Al G@@ ore, Nancy P@@ elo@@ si, Harry Re@@ id, they don't know what they're talking about. 
 So the Al@@ liance for Climate Protec@@ tion has launched two campaig@@ ns. 
 This is one of them, part of one of them. 
 At CO@@ AL@@ ergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. 
 That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about coal. 
 The fact is, coal isn't dir@@ ty. 
 We think it's clean -- smells good, too. 
 So don't worry about climate change. 
 Le@@ ave that up to us. 
 C@@ lean coal -- you've heard a lot about it. 
 So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility. 
 Amaz@@ ing@@ ! The machinery is kind of loud. 
 But that's the sound of clean coal technology. 
 And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. 
 Take a good long loo@@ k: this is today's clean coal technology. 
 Finally, the positive alternative mes@@ h@@ es with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. 
 America is in crisis -- the economy, national security, the climate crisis. 
 The thread that links them all: our addiction to carbon based fu@@ els, like dirty coal and foreign oil. 
 But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. 
 Re@@ power America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years. 
 A plan to put America back to work, make us more sec@@ ure, and help stop global warming. 
 Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. 
 Re@@ power America. F@@ ind out more. 
 This is the last one. 
 It's about re@@ powering America. 
 One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet. 
 Fu@@ tu@@ re's over here. Win@@ d, sun, a new energy gri@@ d. 
 New investments to create high-@@ paying jobs. 
 Re@@ power America. It's time to get real. 
 There is an old African pro@@ verb that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone. 
 If you want to go far, go together@@ ." 
 We need to go far, quickly. 
 Thank you very much. I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid, playing with blocks. 
 As you figured out how to reach out and gras@@ p, pick them up and move them around, you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships. 
 S@@ pati@@ al reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us. 
 So, as a computer scientist inspired by this util@@ ity of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my advis@@ er P@@ atti@@ e, and my collabor@@ ator Je@@ ev@@ an Kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer, instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital finger@@ tip moving around a flat desk@@ top, what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information phys@@ ically, arrang@@ ing it the way we want@@ ed? 
 This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer, by building Si@@ f@@ tables. 
 In a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell, a Si@@ f@@ table is an interactive computer the size of a cooki@@ e. 
 They're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radio. 
 Most importantly, they're physical, so like the bloc@@ ks, you can move them just by reaching out and gr@@ asp@@ ing. 
 And Si@@ f@@ tables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information. 
 And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction sty@@ les. 
 So, I'm going to start with some simple examples. 
 This Si@@ f@@ table is con@@ figured to show video, and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way@@ ; if I tilt it the other way it rol@@ ls it backwards. 
 And these interactive portraits are aware of each other. 
 So if I put them next to each other, they get interested. 
 If they get surroun@@ ded, they notice that too, they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed. 
 And they can also sense their motion and til@@ t. 
 One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realiz@@ e, was that we could use everyday gestures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liqui@@ d. 
 So in this case, we've got three Si@@ f@@ tables con@@ figured to be paint buck@@ ets and I can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mix@@ ed. 
 If we over@@ shoo@@ t, we can pour a little bit back. 
 There are also some neat possibilities for education, like language, math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly, and view the results immediately. 
 So here I'm -- This is a Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. 
 Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -up between S@@ crab@@ ble and Bo@@ gg@@ le. 
 Basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Si@@ f@@ table, and as you try to make words it checks against a diction@@ ary. 
 Then, after about 30 seconds, it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. 
 Thank you. 
 So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab, and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video. 
 They really loved it. 
 And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. 
 All you have to say is, "M@@ ake word@@ s," and they know exactly what to do. 
 So here's another few people trying it out. 
 That's our youngest bet@@ a tes@@ ter, down there on the right. 
 Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Si@@ f@@ tables up. 
 So to him, they were just blocks. 
 Now, this is an interactive cartoon application. 
 And we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners. 
 And this is F@@ eli@@ x, actually. 
 And he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the Si@@ f@@ tables off the table that have that character shown on them. 
 Here, he's bringing the sun out. 
 The sun is ris@@ ing. 
 Now he's brought a tr@@ actor into the scene. 
 The orange tr@@ actor. 
 Good job@@ ! Yeah@@ ! 
 So by shaking the Si@@ f@@ tables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Wo@@ of@@ ! 
 inventing his own narr@@ ative. 
 Hel@@ lo@@ ! 
 It's an open-@@ ended story, and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds. 
 F@@ ly away, cat. 
 So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently, in which Si@@ f@@ tables act as sounds like lead, bas@@ s and dr@@ um@@ s. 
 Each of these has four different vari@@ ations, you get to choose which one you want to use. 
 And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. 
 And you inject it by just bum@@ ping up the sound Si@@ f@@ table against a sequence Si@@ f@@ table. 
 There are effects that you can control live, like rever@@ b and fil@@ ter. 
 You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. 
 And then, overall effects like temp@@ o and volume that apply to the entire sequence. 
 So let's have a look. 
 We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Si@@ f@@ tables, arrange them into a seri@@ es, extend it, add a little more lead@@ . 
 Now I put a bas@@ s line in. 
 Now I'll put some percus@@ sion in. 
 And now I'll attach the filter to the dr@@ ums, so I can control the effect live. 
 I can speed up the whole sequence by til@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other. 
 And now I'll attach the filter to the bas@@ s for some more expression. 
 I can re@@ arrange the sequence while it play@@ s. 
 So I don't have to plan it out in adv@@ ance, but I can improvis@@ e, making it longer or shorter as I go. 
 And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Si@@ f@@ table, til@@ ted to the left. 
 Thank you. 
 So, as you can see, my passion is for making new human-@@ computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work. 
 And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laborator@@ y. 
 So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cus@@ p of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I look forward to talking with all of you.
