H-0	-0.9363278746604919	Today all the world is talking about happiness .
H-1	-1.347228765487671	There &apos;s somebody who wanted to count the number of books in the last five years , which the title of happiness . &quot; He brought to the end of the knee , there was much more .
H-2	-1.0655535459518433	The theme of happiness is in the fashion of the researchers .
H-3	-1.483887791633606	There are a lot of technical techniques of happiness .
H-4	-0.8255642056465149	Everybody wants to make other more happy .
H-5	-2.166698694229126	But despite the number of work , it &apos;s going to be a lot of a lot of a lot of happiness .
H-6	-2.2579150199890137	My talk today is going to be mostly mostly on these cultural features .
H-7	-1.339174747467041	It &apos;s looking at the ones that are thinking about their own happiness , but also the people who think about happiness , because , in the end , we &apos;re all as much as the other .
H-8	-1.399622917175293	The first picture is complexity of complexity .
H-9	-0.7942715883255005	It &apos;s from the fact that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just a useful word , because we use it for too much things .
H-10	-1.2797701358795166	So , after me , we could be it in a particular meaning , but finally it &apos;s a path to give and we &apos;re going to have to adopt the most complex notion of what the well is .
H-11	-1.2251853942871094	And the second of this is the confusion between the lived and memory : it &apos;s just the difference between being happy in his life and be happy of his life , or with his life .
H-12	-1.0849542617797852	And these two concepts are very different , and they &apos;re involved in the notion of the way .
H-13	-2.451896905899048	The third &#91; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The third is , &quot; and it &apos;s this kind of phenomenon that we can &apos;t think that we can &apos;t think about a lot of a lot of their importance .
H-14	-1.6446484327316284	I mean , it &apos;s a real big app .
H-15	-1.2233614921569824	It &apos;s impossible to perceive them .
H-16	-1.1546010971069336	And I &apos;m going to take the example now for a person who made after one of my talks .
H-17	-1.2995294332504272	He said he had listened to a symphony and she was fabulous and everything at the end of reading , there was a horrible way .
H-18	-1.6606454849243164	And he said , pretty soon , that it was going to get all the experience .
H-19	-1.0095182657241821	But no .
H-20	-1.1061328649520874	These are the memories of the experience that had been banned .
H-21	-1.0989161729812622	He lived this experiment .
H-22	-0.5213280320167542	He had 20 minutes of fantastic music .
H-23	-1.4657150506973267	They didn &apos;t have any value , because what was going to be , it was a memory ; the remember was sorry , and this remember , it &apos;s all that was going to be .
H-24	-1.183868646621704	It teaches us , in the bottom , that we can only perceive us and others in two very different entities .
H-25	-1.0012751817703247	There &apos;s a self of me in the moment , which is living in the present and knows the present , it &apos;s able to keep the past , but , essentially , everything he has , it &apos;s the present .
H-26	-1.3868962526321411	It &apos;s this being that the doctor approach -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; It &apos;s really wrong if I get you here ? &quot;
H-27	-1.5760408639907837	And then , there &apos;s the self of me , and it &apos;s the one that is the bank , and it &apos;s the story of our life , and it &apos;s him the physician approach and to say , how do you feel these last few days ? &quot;
H-28	-1.9237257242202759	or &quot; How did you get your head in Albania ? &quot; or things like this .
H-29	-1.0827804803848267	These two entities are very different , the self of the experience and the self of the remember and the wonder is a sources of the problem in the notion of happiness .
H-30	-1.4074208736419678	The self of the remember is a lot of stories .
H-31	-1.0805195569992065	And it really starts by a basic reflex of our memory -- it &apos;s actually immediately .
H-32	-0.7652231454849243	We don &apos;t just tell stories , when we start to tell a story .
H-33	-0.7804364562034607	It &apos;s our memory that tells us stories , in fact , what we &apos;re looking at our lived is a story .
H-34	-0.5553299784660339	And let me start with a example .
H-35	-1.0424304008483887	It &apos;s from a old study .
H-36	-1.9271228313446045	The patients are going to be a painful operation .
H-37	-0.7054190635681152	I &apos;m not going to go into the details . It &apos;s more painful of our days , but it was at the time of this study , in the &apos; 90s .
H-38	-0.9811203479766846	We asked them to describe their pain all the 60 seconds .
H-39	-1.4623082876205444	This is the recording .
H-40	-0.8986594676971436	of two patients .
H-41	-0.9458571076393127	The question is , &quot; What did the most ? &quot;
H-42	-0.39500629901885986	It &apos;s a very simple question .
H-43	-1.0436971187591553	It &apos;s clear that the patient B has more suffered .
H-44	-1.4801591634750366	His year over more long , and for every minute of suffering for the patient , B , B , but even more .
H-45	-1.01404869556427	But here &apos;s a second question : &quot; What do these patients think they have suffered ? &quot;
H-46	-1.3896692991256714	And this is a surprise : This is that the patient has a very worse good than the patient B .
H-47	-1.4148741960525513	It &apos;s a very important point , a very important point of these stories is how they &apos;re doing -- and none of these experiments was a nice or creative -- but one of them can distinguish ...
H-48	-0.9332577586174011	but one of them is worse worse than the other .
H-49	-1.0395095348358154	And the worst is that the pain has a peak all at the end .
H-50	-0.9547381401062012	It &apos;s a great story .
H-51	-0.4671230614185333	How do we know that ?
H-52	-1.0488460063934326	So we asked these people , just after their own , and also long after , &quot; Finally , what it was hard ? &quot;
H-53	-1.9574689865112305	And they had worse goods that B .
H-54	-1.1071404218673706	In fact , it &apos;s a living conflict between the self of the experience and me me .
H-55	-1.3296033143997192	The point of view of the experience of the experience , &quot; clearly , B has spent a very bad moment .
H-56	-1.3173773288726807	Now , what we were able to do with the patient , and , in fact , we &apos;ve been doing medical tests , it was done and this works , we could get the duration of the patient in the patient in the patient , just just the tube in the inside .
H-57	-1.063477873802185	It &apos;s for effect to make the patient , but just a little bit , and well less than before .
H-58	-1.7438102960586548	In doing this for a few minutes , you get a way for the lived , &quot; I &apos;m doing the experience of the patient , and a great improvement for his &quot; I would have to remember , &quot; You &apos;ve now put a patient for a better story about what he lived .
H-59	-0.9050689339637756	What does a story ?
H-60	-0.9809315204620361	And it &apos;s true stories that we &apos;re driven by our memory , like stories that we do .
H-61	-1.1383816003799438	Which defines a story , it &apos;s the changes of situation , the important moments and the end .
H-62	-0.7707708477973938	The final thing is very , very significant and , in this example , the end determines everything .
H-63	-1.220407485961914	So , the self of the experience , &quot; lives his life in the continuity .
H-64	-1.5609732866287231	It &apos;s taking the experiments , one after the other .
H-65	-0.7770698666572571	And if you ask what happens to these moments ,
H-66	-1.653779149055481	The answer is pretty strong :
H-67	-0.9773642420768738	They &apos;re lost to never .
H-68	-1.015865683555603	What I want to say is that most of our life of our life -- and I &apos;ve got to do -- the psychological present is about three seconds .
H-69	-1.0095258951187134	What means , in clear , that there &apos;s about 600 million in a life .
H-70	-0.851678192615509	In a month , it &apos;s about 600 pounds .
H-71	-1.2887805700302124	Most of them don &apos;t leave it .
H-72	-1.5984817743301392	Most of them are completely excited by our &quot; I would remember it . &quot;
H-73	-0.9720219373703003	But yet , sometimes you take consciousness that they should count , that what &apos;s going on for these moments where we live a experience , it &apos;s our life .
H-74	-0.774593710899353	It &apos;s the limited resource that we use in our life on Earth .
H-75	-1.3841482400894165	And the way of using it , seem to be familiar , but it &apos;s not this story that our &quot; I would remember it .
H-76	-1.1479740142822266	In the end , we have our wonder , &quot; and our &quot; self of the experience , &quot; and they &apos;re really quite different .
H-77	-0.729150116443634	The biggest difference between them is the perception of time .
H-78	-1.1960783004760742	So , the point of your view of your experience , &quot; if you &apos;re in vacation , and the second week is going on as well as the first , then these two weeks of vacation will be two times better than a single week .
H-79	-1.3398152589797974	It &apos;s not all like that it &apos;s happening for our &quot; I &apos;m going to remember it . &quot;
H-80	-1.1185758113861084	For him , two weeks of two weeks , it will be better than a single week because no remember is added .
H-81	-0.6229875087738037	You don &apos;t changed the story .
H-82	-1.8539825677871704	It &apos;s a lot of this angle , the time is actually the dominant variable that would call our &quot; me to remember &quot; from our experience . &quot;
H-83	-1.059615135192871	The time is that little impact on this story .
H-84	-1.5900946855545044	And the &quot; I &apos;m going to remember , &quot; Well , more than memorize and tell stories .
H-85	-1.2712593078613281	In reality , it &apos;s him who takes decisions because , if you have a patient who has been a patient , say , two , two of two different surgeons , and that has to decide that choose , and the one that the memories is the least bad , it &apos;s this surgeon that will be chosen .
H-86	-1.3897658586502075	The &quot; I have the experience , &quot; doesn &apos;t have his word to say in this choice .
H-87	-0.8552324771881104	In fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiments ,
H-88	-1.1059134006500244	we choose between memories of these experiments .
H-89	-0.682929277420044	And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think about in terms of experiments .
H-90	-1.2002218961715698	We think about our future in making the memories .
H-91	-2.023033857345581	You can represent this just just like a picture of &quot; me &quot; I can represent it , &quot; I would show the &quot; I would remember &quot; like from the experience of the experience of the experience that the &quot; self of the experience &quot; I don &apos;t demand .
H-92	-1.5704493522644043	I feel that when you get in vacation is very common , it &apos;s to say that you &apos;re in vacation , in a certain way , the orders of our &quot; I would remember it . &quot;
H-93	-0.695477306842804	And I think , it &apos;s pretty hard to justify .
H-94	-1.5480622053146362	In clear , how do we feed us from our memories ?
H-95	-1.9737257957458496	It &apos;s one of the explanations that is going to be in the opposite of our &quot; I would remember it . &quot;
H-96	-1.441191554069519	And it was thinking about the vacation that we had done in Antarctica , there &apos;s a few years ago , which was just the best vacation I &apos;ve ever ever had , and I think about some often , in the number of times where I think .
H-97	-1.2620798349380493	And in my other vacation . I &apos;ve probably spread my memories of this three weeks , while I would say , about 25 minutes for four years .
H-98	-1.4038323163986206	After , if I had open one time that contains 600 photos , I would have spent a extra hour .
H-99	-1.3914268016815186	This was three weeks and the end that doesn &apos;t do a hour and a half time .
H-100	-2.7647836208343506	That &apos;s a good bit .
H-101	-1.1879911422729492	And it &apos;s possible that I &apos;m not a representative of the average , in this that I have little taste for the consumption of my memories , but even if you have more than me , a fundamental question to ask :
H-102	-1.2684308290481567	Why do we make a lot of weight to our memories , comparison from the one that we give our experiments ?
H-103	-0.6250957250595093	I want you to think about a brain experience .
H-104	-1.7318369150161743	Imagine that at your next vacation , that at the end of these vacation , all your pictures are destroyed , and you &apos;re able to make a drink that makes you to do that you don &apos;t want to do .
H-105	-1.576898455619812	So , let &apos;s look at you the same type of vacation ?
H-106	-1.0023419857025146	And if you were a other choice , there would be a conflict between your two entities , and you have to think about how the conflict is , and it &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about terms of the way , you &apos;ll have a answer .
H-107	-0.7292879223823547	And if you think about memories , you might have another answer .
H-108	-1.5244330167770386	Why do you take the vacation that we &apos;re going to be , it &apos;s a problem that will face us to a choice between the two . &quot;
H-109	-1.6730188131332397	The two of me , we &apos;re going to be in two ways of happiness .
H-110	-1.5372042655944824	There are actually two kinds of happiness that are happening to each other .
H-111	-1.3751661777496338	So we &apos;re asking : What is the self of the experience , &quot; is it happy ?
H-112	-1.4130784273147583	What point are happy these moments in life &apos;s life ? &quot;
H-113	-0.9181367754936218	They &apos;re all , the happiness of the moment is a pretty complex process .
H-114	-1.1271671056747437	What are the emotions that you can quantify ?
H-115	-1.1918216943740845	Now , now we have a more clear idea of what the happiness &apos;s happiness . &quot;
H-116	-1.021685004234314	If you think about happiness &apos;s happiness , &quot; it &apos;s a whole other story .
H-117	-0.7998180985450745	It doesn &apos;t have to see with the fact of having a happy life .
H-118	-0.995689332485199	But how you &apos;re doing , or happy , thinking about our life .
H-119	-1.4226807355880737	It &apos;s very different .
H-120	-1.5639457702636719	There doesn &apos;t call these two notions is on the point of how the study of happiness , and I &apos;m going to the crowd of students of the well , which has been the study of happiness for a long time , precisely in this way .
H-121	-1.4854891300201416	And the distinction between the happiness of our &quot; me from the experience , &quot; and the satisfaction of our &quot; me , &quot; I &apos;ve got to remember that very recently , and there are now projects so to measure the two things . The Copenhagen organization has made a poll for 500 people in their asking what they thought of their lives and their experiments .
H-122	-0.792570948600769	And there are other actions in this sense .
H-123	-0.9722166061401367	And in the last few years , we started learning things about the happiness of two . &quot;
H-124	-0.5528678894042969	According to me , the main lesson that we &apos;ve learned is that these two entities are very different .
H-125	-1.402169108390808	You can see that a person is a lot of his life , but it doesn &apos;t tell you a lot of happiness with the degree of happiness with which she lives his life , and it .
H-126	-0.5097963809967041	Just to give you a idea of the correlation , the correlation is about five .
H-127	-1.0230023860931396	It &apos;s like if you get someone who tells you that his father does two feet . What can you say about the size of this person ?
H-128	-0.8658782839775085	Well , you have a indication , but there &apos;s a huge degree of uncertainty .
H-129	-0.8724979162216187	You have a lot of uncertainty .
H-130	-1.5708811283111572	If I told you that a person to say his life eight of 10 , you &apos;re not a lot of uncertainty to do the level of happiness of his experience . &quot;
H-131	-1.1084781885147095	If the correlation is low .
H-132	-1.3581862449645996	We know a little bit of what control the satisfaction of happiness .
H-133	-0.8981748819351196	We know that money has a important place , the goals also .
H-134	-1.2910114526748657	We know that happiness is mostly from people that we know , the time we &apos;re going on with them .
H-135	-1.681490182876587	There are other pleasures , but this kind of thing .
H-136	-1.1285967826843262	So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two &quot; me , &quot; you &apos;re going to end up to do very different things .
H-137	-1.180429220199585	The most of my things is that we really should &apos;t think about happiness as well as well .
H-138	-1.188787579536438	These are two very different things .
H-139	-1.2696506977081299	For a short reason , another reason that we &apos;re trying to have the cool ideas about happiness , is that we don &apos;t think about the same things when we think about life or well when we lives .
H-140	-1.1800457239151	If you ask the simple question of knowing how much the people &apos;s people are happy , you don &apos;t have a correct answer .
H-141	-0.6153022050857544	When you ask this question , you think people have to be more happy in California , that , say , in the Ohio .
H-142	-0.4269552230834961	And what there is , when you think about life in California , you think about contrast between California and other places , and contrast , say , is in climate .
H-143	-0.861388087272644	Well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the experience of the experience , &quot; not more than for the &quot; I think &quot; and that decides if people are happy .
H-144	-1.9221065044403076	But , good , because it &apos;s the &quot; I think , &quot; who will be able to be a little bit of moving to the California .
H-145	-0.9714645147323608	It would be interesting , to follow those who are going to be in California , in the hope of being more happy .
H-146	-1.3461142778396606	In fact , their self of the experience . It &apos;s not going to be happier .
H-147	-1.1719218492507935	We &apos;ve all aware of it .
H-148	-0.9802546501159668	But it will happen a thing : They will be convinced to be more happy . Because , when they &apos;re doing , they get the bad time in Ohio .
H-149	-1.1272660493850708	And they &apos;re going to take the good decision .
H-150	-1.3933159112930298	It &apos;s very hard to evaluate properly its well . I hope you have shown how much it &apos;s hard .
H-151	-0.8387041091918945	Thank you .
H-152	-0.4411815106868744	Thank you . I have a question to ask you .
H-153	-0.4506116807460785	Thank you very much .
H-154	-1.1626290082931519	There &apos;s a few weeks ago , we talked about the phone , you told me that the Gallup poll had provided some pretty interesting results .
H-155	-1.097940444946289	Can you tell you more now that you have a little bit of time ?
H-156	-0.8477616310119629	Of course .
H-157	-1.4805576801300049	So , after me , the most significant result of this thing is a number , that we don &apos;t really have to find .
H-158	-1.2432293891906738	We found this about happiness from the experience of the experience . &quot;
H-159	-1.4144128561019897	When we &apos;re looking at how happiness is going to function of income .
H-160	-0.9301686882972717	And he came out that below 60 dollars per year , for Americans , and it was a very important sample , over 600 pounds , it &apos;s a very representative sample , below 600 dollars per year --
H-161	-2.2529284954071045	Let &apos;s go .
H-162	-2.2529284954071045	Let &apos;s go .
H-163	-0.6306454539299011	60 dollars per year , people are unhappy , and less they make more they &apos;re unhappy .
H-164	-1.0880440473556519	In the top , the happiness line is absolutely flat .
H-165	-1.524060845375061	Finally , I &apos;ve never seen a line as flat line .
H-166	-1.7571862936019897	We clearly see that the money don &apos;t buy you to be happy experiments , but by the way you &apos;re able to be sure the misery , and you can quantify this misery of a very precise way .
H-167	-1.1899853944778442	For the other entity , the &quot; I would remember , &quot; It &apos;s a whole other story .
H-168	-1.4507468938827515	The more you get money , more you &apos;re satisfied .
H-169	-0.5695083737373352	It doesn &apos;t work for emotions .
H-170	-0.9136919379234314	Danny , the rest of the United States is entirely based on life , freedom and search of happiness .
H-171	-1.3130825757980347	If you give credit to these research , they have the air to go to the current of all what we believe , for example , the taxes and so on .
H-172	-1.6344919204711914	Is it a lucky chance that the leaders , that the country , in his together , take a kind of discovery in serious , and put the political policy on it ?
H-173	-1.039893627166748	I think the role of the research on happiness are known in the public policy .
H-174	-0.706092894077301	This recognition is slow to the U.S. , it &apos;s certain , but in England , it &apos;s going to happen , and also in other countries .
H-175	-1.4657663106918335	People recognize that they have to take to take the happiness when they &apos;re looking about public policy .
H-176	-1.2118964195251465	It &apos;s going to take time , we &apos;re going to do , if we want to do experiments to study happiness , or if you want studies on life . We need to start this debate quickly . How do happiness can take a different ways to think of thinking , and if you think about you . &quot;
H-177	-0.7839549779891968	It &apos;s going to influence the political decisions , I think , in the years that come .
H-178	-1.4884833097457886	In the United States , of the efforts , to measure the happiness lived of the population .
H-179	-1.2279874086380005	It &apos;s going to be , after me , in 10 or 20 years , go in the national statistics .
H-180	-0.9231545329093933	Well , it turns to me that this problem will be , or at least should be , the most interesting debate to follow in the next years .
H-181	-0.7288364768028259	Thank you very much for the invention of the behavioral economy .
H-182	-0.8074410557746887	Thank you Daniel Daniel . I &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago while I was writing a article for Wired Italy .
H-183	-1.1410566568374634	I always have my dictionary in the hand of the hand when I write , but I &apos;ve already finished the paper and I realized that I had never , in my life , looked at the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see what I &apos;d like .
H-184	-0.8787781000137329	Let me read you the entrance .
H-185	-3.3513388633728027	&quot; you say , &quot; you know , &quot; Well , well , no , useless , guilty , etc , let , say , it will be a lot of . You know , you know , well , expensive , paralyzed , paralyzed , free , you know , well , you know , you know , useless and weak .
H-186	-1.471868634223938	in good health , strong , capable . &quot;
H-187	-1.2535076141357422	I was reading this list to high voice to a friend and at the beginning , I was so familiar , but I just did , I had just past , &quot; and my voice turned up , and I had to stop me to get me for the emotional shock and the impact that the expansion of these words .
H-188	-0.9019603133201599	You know , of course , it &apos;s my old dictionary in the bottom .
H-189	-1.2784870862960815	I &apos;m going to say that has to be a old time of feeling , right .
H-190	-1.0673307180404663	But in fact , the feeling of feeling was at the beginning of the &apos; 80s , at the moment I had to start the elementary school and form a understanding of me in the family and report with the other children and the world around me .
H-191	-1.2164479494094849	And useless to say that God thank I didn &apos;t use this dictionary at the time .
H-192	-1.367711067199707	I mean , after this entrance , it would find that I was born in a world that are doing people like me like me to be nothing with them , so in fact , today , I &apos;m going to go to opportunities and the adventures that my life has me .
H-193	-2.0470962524414062	So I &apos;m just going to go back in the 2009 in 2009 in me to be able to find a very way .
H-194	-1.3850305080413818	This is the version of this entrance .
H-195	-0.6614753007888794	Unfortunately , it &apos;s not a lot better .
H-196	-1.7044366598129272	I find the last couple of words in &quot; &quot; especially , &quot; especially , &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
H-197	-0.5618373155593872	So , it &apos;s not just a story of words .
H-198	-0.6777185797691345	That &apos;s what we think about people when we put them with these words .
H-199	-0.4741792380809784	These are the values behind the words , and how we build these values .
H-200	-0.5891392230987549	Our language influence our thought and our way to see the world and see others .
H-201	-1.7356352806091309	In fact , a lot of companies , which the Greeks and the Romans , believed that it is a very powerful , because it &apos;s the high @-@ voice thing .
H-202	-1.0181268453598022	So what reality do we want to do , a person who &apos;s limited , or a person who has capabilities ?
H-203	-1.5634005069732666	In order to make something as simple as a person , a child , we could be able to grow and get their power .
H-204	-1.5314007997512817	Do we don &apos;t want to be pretty much to open the doors ?
H-205	-1.5448846817016602	One of these people , who opened me to the doors , was my pediatrician at the National institute in the ground .
H-206	-1.3841015100479126	His name is Dr. .
H-207	-1.1025484800338745	A American @-@ American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult to be for most Americans , so he became Dr. SP .
H-208	-2.4205710887908936	And Dr. Joe was always a very large and a lot of the most perfect interest to work with children .
H-209	-1.2716779708862305	I almost almost loved the time I spent in this hospital , in the exception of my favorites .
H-210	-1.333785057067871	I had to do what was going to be a lot of me with these big cups -- different colors -- you know , to help to build the muscles of my legs .
H-211	-1.7950905561447144	And I &apos;m looking at these things more than everything .
H-212	-1.4812313318252563	I hated them , I get them . I put them .
H-213	-1.1993283033370972	And you know , I &apos;ve been already , at five years , with Dr. SP to try to try to do these , obviously without success .
H-214	-1.2381631135940552	And one day he came to my session -- and you know , &quot; You know , and he said , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you &apos;re really a little strong girl , and powerful , I think you &apos;re going to break one of these bike .
H-215	-0.8789490461349487	When you get it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
H-216	-1.394149899482727	Of course , it was just a gentleman from Dr. SP &apos;s part of me to do that , that I didn &apos;t want to do in the perspective of going to become a five @-@ year @-@ old @-@ old year of the floor , but what he really did done for me , it was to transform a little event in a new new experience .
H-217	-1.1084104776382446	And I ask me today , in how much its vision , and the fact that he had me a little strong girl and powerful , have drew my own vision of myself in the future , as a person by a strong , powerful , powerful nature .
H-218	-0.8025306463241577	It &apos;s a example of how adults , in position of power , can get the power of a child .
H-219	-1.3157424926757812	But , in the last few examples of these dictionaries dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to evolve in the reality that we all change , the possibility for a individual to be able to be able to be able to do .
H-220	-1.0070003271102905	Our language has not followed the changes of our society , which many have been brought by technology .
H-222	-0.9536380171775818	So , maybe technology we reveals more clearly now what has always been , that everybody has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the ability of human adaptation is our biggest asset .
H-223	-1.2265489101409912	The human ability to adapt , it &apos;s interesting , because people always wanted to tell me to talk about poverty , and I &apos;m going to do one .
H-224	-1.0595424175262451	This sentence never was going to me , and I &apos;m always embarrassed when we ask me questions about this theme , and I think I start to understand why .
H-226	-0.7836073637008667	But in fact , we &apos;re changed . We &apos;re tagged , of course , by a challenge , that it &apos;s physically , emotionally , or two .
H-227	-0.5167490839958191	And I want to say that it &apos;s a good thing .
H-228	-1.4424365758895874	The leadership is not a obstacle that we need to go to the course of our life .
H-229	-0.5260216593742371	It &apos;s part of our life .
H-230	-0.5474730134010315	And I tend to see it as my shadow .
H-231	-0.7764860987663269	Sometimes I see it in great , sometimes in small , but it &apos;s always with me .
H-232	-1.0650919675827026	And of course , I &apos;m not trying to get here from the impact , the weight , from a person of a person .
H-233	-1.1030490398406982	There &apos;s life and challenge in life , and all it &apos;s very real and connected to every person , but the question is not if you &apos;re going to go or not meet the leadership , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
H-234	-1.3477020263671875	So our responsibility is not just to protect the importance of what we love , but to prepare them for the height .
H-235	-1.2588684558868408	And we don &apos;t have to service to our kids when we feel them feel that they &apos;re not prepared to adapt .
H-236	-1.4094599485397339	There &apos;s a difference and a important distinction between the fact that I &apos;m growing and the social social opinion of saying if yes or not I am .
H-237	-1.6718759536743164	And really , the only real time and repeated that I had to confront is that the world always think that I could be able to put to these definitions .
H-238	-1.0384691953659058	In our desire to protect those that we love to give them the red truth and cold , or , in fact , a drug on the quality of life that they can wait , we need to make sure that we don &apos;t ask the first brick of a wall that &apos;s really going to get a person .
H-239	-1.3652169704437256	Maybe the existing model , to look at that what &apos;s broken in you and how we &apos;re going to fix it , if it &apos;s going to fix it , if it turns to be more more for the individual that pathology itself itself .
H-240	-1.8079009056091309	It &apos;s not taking the person in his whole thing , not not not get his potential , we create another disease in more of the natural world that it can already have .
H-241	-1.142585277557373	We really want people in their value for our community .
H-242	-1.3694053888320923	So we need to see beyond pathology and the human of human skills .
H-243	-1.101609706878662	And , more importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between these creative , and the best of our creative ability .
H-244	-1.7173762321472168	It &apos;s not to minimize , or in course , these amazing moments like something to avoid or to the end , but rather than to find the hidden chances in poverty .
H-245	-1.5252158641815186	So maybe the idea that I want to do is , not so much to defeat it , that we open it , and you know , to use it , to use a term term , maybe even dance with her .
H-246	-1.419839859008789	And , perhaps , if we see the incentive as natural , healthy and useful , its presence is less than a burden .
H-247	-1.072239637374878	And this year , the year of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when he was writing on evolution , that Darwin came up , I think , a truth on the human character .
H-248	-1.3043099641799927	So , in course , it &apos;s not the most strong of the species that &apos;s going on , not the most intelligent , it &apos;s the most able to adapt to change .
H-249	-1.000807285308838	The conflict is the genesis of creation .
H-250	-0.8686895966529846	In the work of Darwin , among others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and thrive is driven by the struggle of human mind , through conflict , to transformation .
H-251	-0.9456053972244263	So again , transformation , adaptation , are the most big gift of the man .
H-252	-1.2096635103225708	And , perhaps , as we &apos;re not put to the point , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made .
H-253	-1.0363651514053345	Maybe it &apos;s what the importance has us , a sense of ourselves , a sense of our own power .
H-254	-0.7309690713882446	So we can do a gift .
H-255	-1.5697418451309204	We can see the importance as something more than just hard time .
H-256	-0.9034594297409058	We can can see it like change .
H-257	-1.709301471710205	The importance is just a change that we &apos;re not going to have yet .
H-258	-1.8557279109954834	And I think the most biggest importance that we &apos;ve created for us that is the idea of us .
H-259	-0.8867270350456238	So , that is normal ?
H-260	-0.7343962788581848	There &apos;s no normal .
H-261	-0.8130185604095459	There &apos;s common . There &apos;s the typical . There &apos;s no normal .
H-262	-1.2883903980255127	And you want to meet this poor person ?
H-263	-0.46707478165626526	I don &apos;t think .
H-264	-0.9715988636016846	If we can change this paradigm , from the idea of order to make the difference , in the possibility , or the power , to be even a little bit more dangerous , we can release the power of so many other children , and invite them to exploit their rare and valuable talents , in the community .
H-265	-0.7339841723442078	The anthropologists tell us that the only thing we have , as humans , always asked the members of our communities , is to be useful , to be able to contribute .
H-266	-1.470497965812683	We have the evidence that the men &apos;s men , 60 years ago , who were 60 years ago and those who were quite wounded , and , maybe , because the experience of a life to survive , in these people , in those people , they didn &apos;t see these people as be broken and useless : they saw them as rare and valuable .
H-267	-0.8970555663108826	There &apos;s a few years ago , I was in a market in the city where I grew up in this red area in the North East part of the Pennsylvania , and I went to the top of a tomatoes of tomatoes .
H-268	-1.0785495042800903	It was the summer . I was wearing a shorts .
H-269	-0.7853056192398071	I hear this guy , his voice behind me , &quot; Look , if it &apos;s not Aimee . &quot;
H-270	-0.8945580124855042	And I go back , and there &apos;s this gentleman . I don &apos;t have any idea of which is .
H-271	-0.7336941361427307	And I said , &quot; Oh , sir , we know ? I don &apos;t remember you met . &quot;
H-272	-0.8988695740699768	He said , &quot; Well , you can &apos;t remember me to have met .
H-273	-1.1424620151519775	I mean , when we &apos;ve been met I was going to get the belly of your mother . &quot;
H-274	-0.38673514127731323	Oh , this guy .
H-275	-1.1323401927947998	And , of course , I &apos;ve got it .
H-276	-0.8736587762832642	This gentleman was Dr. , a man I had known that through the stories of my mother on this day , because , of course , typical , I had two weeks of the day of my birth .
H-277	-1.2719802856445312	And so the doctor &apos;s worth of my mother was gone in the vacation , and the man who put me in the world was a complete stranger for my parents .
H-278	-0.9215980172157288	And , as I was born without , and I had the feet in the inside , and some toes on this foot , and a few toes on this foot , he had to be the fight , this stranger had to be the bad news .
H-279	-0.8924951553344727	He said , &quot; I had to give it to your parents that you never do , and you would never have this kind of mobility that have the other children or no kind of independence in life , and you &apos;ve done me a liar for this day . &quot;
H-281	-0.7872998714447021	And he called this part of the course , the X @-@ ray , the potential of the human will .
H-282	-1.604108452796936	None of them can represent how much it can be a powerful shift in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
H-283	-1.3664567470550537	And Dr. , he continued to tell me , he said , &quot; First after my experience , at least that we don &apos;t give him the opposite , and by having the support of support , if you leave it to do , a child . &quot;
H-284	-1.150364637374878	See , Dr. , it changed his way to think .
H-285	-0.6608335971832275	He understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what one person can do .
H-286	-1.2911866903305054	And my way of thinking has changed with time , in the sense where you had asked the question 15 years ago , whether I would have to get my prostheses against legs in flesh and bones , I wouldn &apos;t have a second .
H-287	-1.971832513809204	And in this time , I &apos;m going to be in this kind of magnitude .
H-288	-0.9824507832527161	If you ask me today , I &apos;m not also sure .
H-289	-1.1177966594696045	And this is with experiments that I &apos;ve got with them , not despite the experience that I did with them .
H-290	-1.4963222742080688	And perhaps , this change in me happened because I &apos;ve been exposed to more people who opened me the doors that people who asked me a lot of it and put me .
H-291	-0.7512610554695129	See , everything you need is a person that shows you the epiphany of your own power , and you &apos;re part .
H-292	-0.883388876914978	If you can give someone the key of its own power , the human mind is if many , if you can do that and open the door to someone in a critical moment , you put them in the best sense .
H-293	-0.9976841807365417	You teach them to open themselves themselves .
H-294	-1.232415795326233	In fact , the exact sense of the opposite word comes from the root . &quot;
H-295	-1.1211986541748047	She means , produce what &apos;s inside , to make the potential .
H-296	-1.168653130531311	So what do we want to reveal ?
H-297	-1.138863444328308	A study has been done in the &apos; 60s in Britain , when they were looking at the elementary school to school school .
H-298	-1.4253687858581543	It &apos;s called the trial in the flow . We call this &quot; right here in the United States .
H-299	-1.053031325340271	This is to separate the students by note , B , C , D and D .
H-300	-0.6868031024932861	And the students have the most difficult program , the best teachers , etc .
H-301	-1.108517050743103	So they took , on a three @-@ month period , high @-@ D students , they gave them , they said they were At A A , that they were smart .
H-302	-1.1215085983276367	And at the end of the three months , they had the results of the level .
H-303	-1.06117844581604	And , of course , the side of this study , it &apos;s that they took the students , and they said they were a D level .
H-304	-0.5184017419815063	And that &apos;s what happened at the end of these three months .
H-305	-1.0903862714767456	Those who were in the corner , in school , in more of those who were abandoned .
H-306	-1.4784057140350342	A essential point of this study study is that teachers were also limited .
H-307	-0.9445163011550903	The teachers didn &apos;t know that we had a exchange .
H-308	-1.7544947862625122	We just told them here , the students , here &apos;s the students D .
H-309	-0.9203404784202576	And that &apos;s the way they put to teach them and treat them .
H-310	-1.444875955581665	So , I think the only real belief is a brand mind , a mind that &apos;s closed is not hope .
H-311	-0.633510172367096	It doesn &apos;t see the beauty .
H-312	-1.2979674339294434	It doesn &apos;t have our natural curiosity , and our ability to imagine .
H-313	-1.2617546319961548	If in the place , you can support a human mind to be hope , that it sees the beauty in itself and in the other , that it &apos;s curious and but , then we use our power to be good .
H-314	-0.5543886423110962	When a mind has these qualities , we &apos;re able to create new realities and new ways of being .
H-315	-1.295541524887085	I &apos;d like to leave you with a poem of a poet in the 20th century , called the way that told me my friend Jacques Jacques .
H-316	-0.5423562526702881	And the poem is called &quot; The god that doesn &apos;t know four words . &quot;
H-317	-0.9684246778488159	&quot; Every child has known God , not the God of names , not the god of &quot; don &apos;t do , &quot; but the God who don &apos;t know that four words and the track without her , who said , &quot; Come to me &quot; Come to me .
H-318	-0.99635910987854	Thank you . For a time , I &apos;m interested in the placebo effect , which can be weird for a magician like a magician , at least that you don &apos;t look at something like me : is &quot; something wrong can be so fortunate that it becomes something true . &quot;
H-319	-0.8632398247718811	In other words , sugar pills have some effects in some kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that happens is a pharmaceutical effect .
H-320	-0.7145717740058899	For the pain of pain , for example , if they believe pretty strong , there is a measurable effect in their body that we call the placebo effect .
H-321	-1.3027477264404297	Something else becomes something real because to the perception of someone .
H-322	-1.456882357597351	So what we &apos;re going to do , I &apos;m going to show you something about this , a very simple magic .
H-323	-0.8229110240936279	I &apos;m going to show you how it works . It &apos;s a turn that has been in all the books of magic for children for the &apos; 50s .
H-324	-2.3925108909606934	I &apos;ve got it learned from the same 60s in the &apos; 70s .
H-325	-1.0445419549942017	I &apos;m going to do it and you explain it .
H-326	-0.7108426690101624	I &apos;ll tell you why I explained it .
H-327	-0.7107813358306885	That &apos;s what happens .
H-328	-0.7070772647857666	The knife , that you can look at ; my hand , you can look at .
H-329	-0.8927928805351257	I &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my wife like this .
H-330	-2.1056830883026123	I &apos;m going to do my sleeve .
H-331	-0.9514892101287842	To be sure that there &apos;s nothing in my sleeves , I &apos;m just going to break my wrist here .
H-332	-1.8144536018371582	As you can see that at any point what it can &apos;t happen . As I can &apos;t get nothing to be coming out of my sleeve .
H-333	-0.8853431940078735	The object of this tower is pretty simple .
H-334	-1.7518526315689087	I &apos;m going to open my hand , in hoping , if it &apos;s going to be good , that my great animal is going to get the knife in place .
H-335	-1.2246596813201904	In fact , it &apos;s so good that I can see it and the knife doesn &apos;t fall .
H-336	-1.3125685453414917	Nothing doesn &apos;t go out of my sleeve , no thing . You can look at it .
H-337	-2.4460132122039795	Your da !
H-338	-1.3064916133880615	This is a trick that I often learn to young kids who are interested about magic , because you can learn a lot of things on the illusion in the student of the way -- even if it &apos;s a very simple tower .
H-339	-0.9188200235366821	There &apos;s probably a lot of people in the room who know this tower .
H-340	-0.7107813358306885	That &apos;s what happens .
H-341	-0.6370248198509216	I want the knife in my hand .
H-342	-0.9737990498542786	I &apos;m saying that I &apos;m going to hold my wrist to be sure that nothing is not coming out of my sleeve . It &apos;s a lie .
H-343	-0.604071319103241	The reason I want my wrist , it &apos;s because it &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
H-344	-1.6592379808425903	At the time when my hand went up to get out , this finger just here , my index , going on where it is to a huge position like this .
H-345	-1.1091941595077515	Not bad .
H-346	-0.8205391764640808	There &apos;s somebody who didn &apos;t have childhood here .
H-347	-0.9795246124267578	So , it &apos;s like this , here , here .
H-348	-1.108386516571045	When I move , my finger changes of place .
H-349	-0.8401676416397095	We could talk about why it &apos;s a illusion , why you don &apos;t notice that there &apos;s only three fingers here , because the mind , in the way he has to treat information , it doesn &apos;t think , two , three .
H-350	-1.028291940689087	It &apos;s not really the subject . There , I open my hand .
H-351	-2.219616174697876	So it &apos;s not , not by a great animal , but by deception , my index being here .
H-352	-1.780375361442566	After when I farm my finger , the same , I &apos;m going to go up : this movement is doing a way in the finger of the finger .
H-353	-0.9289848208427429	I take this hand . I give you the knife .
H-354	-0.6327744722366333	It &apos;s a turn that you can do your friends and neighbors . Thank you .
H-355	-0.9018705487251282	Now , what does it have to see with the placebo effect ?
H-356	-0.9062961935997009	I read a study , there &apos;s about a year that really actually opened the mind .
H-357	-0.8853632211685181	I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so that , for me , it was a real thing .
H-358	-1.4846479892730713	It turns out that if you put a placebo under the form of a white colony , it &apos;s like the form of a mirror , it &apos;s just a white and and and a kind of measurable effect .
H-359	-1.4726793766021729	If you change the form of the placebo , like for example of a more small , and the blue color , with a letter in the way , it &apos;s actually more effective in a way .
H-360	-1.5554145574569702	Well of the two products is a drug -- these are sugar of sugar .
H-361	-1.2830528020858765	But a white white is not as good as a blue .
H-362	-1.878187894821167	What ? I &apos;ve got me .
H-363	-0.804890513420105	It turns out that it doesn &apos;t stop there .
H-364	-1.3920620679855347	If you &apos;ve got , they &apos;re more efficient than the seals under all the forms .
H-365	-1.3108066320419312	A lot of it , which is yellow from a side and red side of the other , is better than a white side .
H-366	-1.4251456260681152	This is something to see with this .
H-367	-1.305060625076294	A two times a day is not as good as three . I don &apos;t remember statistics -- sorry .
H-368	-0.6460195779800415	What I want to say ,
H-369	-1.3916290998458862	It &apos;s that the ones have something to see with this .
H-370	-0.7458634376525879	The shape is also for something .
H-371	-0.8759430646896362	If you want the ultimate placebo , you have the needle .
H-372	-1.7848001718521118	One syringe with something in the world , a few inches of something that you get in the patient .
H-373	-1.150036334991455	It &apos;s a very powerful image in his mind , it &apos;s so more strong than the white vessel .
H-374	-1.0651322603225708	The graph , I &apos;m going to show you to one point when we &apos;ll have slides .
H-375	-1.109704613685608	And what I mean is that white vessels is not as good as blue , which is not as good as the same , which is not as good as the needle , which is not as good as the needle .
H-376	-2.1326723098754883	No one is the real public quality .
H-377	-0.74868243932724	This is that your belief that makes it real in your body and gives a more strong effect .
H-378	-0.5320023894309998	I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it a magic .
H-379	-1.7082065343856812	Just something that &apos;s apparently a big tower and give him the appearance of reality .
H-380	-0.6444492340087891	We know this study that , when you want reality , you take the needle .
H-381	-1.4788005352020264	This is a 18 @-@ inch . It &apos;s very glamorous .
H-382	-1.1162036657333374	I &apos;m just going to do it a little bit .
H-383	-1.0907288789749146	It &apos;s really my flesh . It &apos;s not the flesh that you grow .
H-384	-0.6435412764549255	It &apos;s my skin right here . It &apos;s not a special effect of Hollywood .
H-385	-1.019667625427246	I &apos;m going to take my skin and spend this needle through the other side .
H-386	-1.1132659912109375	If you don &apos;t take the view of the blood , if you fall into the easily apples -- I was doing this turn to friends in my hotel room at some of the people I didn &apos;t know , and a lady has almost turned to the eye --
H-387	-0.6248016357421875	if you &apos;re sensitive , look at the next 30 seconds . In fact , you know what , I &apos;m going to do the hard part behind .
H-388	-0.6163692474365234	You can see , but you can also look at the way .
H-389	-0.7737453579902649	So , this is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh in the lower part of the arm , I &apos;m just going to have a little bit .
H-390	-0.9295470118522644	I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m going to be afraid ?
H-391	-0.9550763368606567	And then a little bit of through my skin , it comes out of the other side like this .
H-392	-1.3718217611312866	We &apos;re basically in the same situation that with the knife .
H-393	-1.8368240594863892	In a kind of it .
H-394	-0.6773456931114197	You can &apos;t count my fingers here ?
H-395	-0.7048026919364929	Let me show you . Here &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
H-396	-1.0135376453399658	Yeah , good ...
H-397	-0.6987887024879456	I know what people are saying when they see that .
H-398	-0.9846202731132507	They do , &quot; It &apos;s not enough enough to plant things through the skin to have a few minutes . &quot;
H-399	-0.6952797770500183	Let me give you a glimpse .
H-400	-1.0820220708847046	What it looks like here ? Not bad .
H-401	-0.27897220849990845	Yeah , I know .
H-402	-1.0730056762695312	The people are saying , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t really have seen this . &quot;
H-403	-1.3375073671340942	The people in the room is starting to enter in ours .
H-404	-0.947410523891449	Let me show you about about it .
H-405	-0.39626944065093994	It &apos;s really my skin . It &apos;s not a special effect of Hollywood .
H-406	-1.0334550142288208	It &apos;s my flesh and I can turn .
H-407	-0.9099161028862	I &apos;m sorry . If you feel wrong , look at the way , don &apos;t look that .
H-408	-1.079389214515686	The people in the bottom or those who will look at the video video later , &quot; yeah , it &apos;s not wrong the species of effect there , but if it was true , see , there &apos;s a hole here and , if it was true , it &apos;s true . &quot;
H-409	-0.6900129318237305	Well let me get you a little bit of blood .
H-410	-1.1620370149612427	Yeah , this is .
H-411	-1.0342442989349365	Just now , I should take the needle .
H-412	-0.9508872628211975	I &apos;m doing my arm and I show you that there &apos;s no injuries but I think that in this context and in the idea of taking something and make it real , I &apos;m just going to leave it like this and leave the stage .
H-413	-2.010254144668579	We &apos;re going to get several times these next days .
H-414	-1.0228203535079956	I hope you &apos;ll want to want it . Thank you very much . My name is Jane syndrome . I &apos;m a game .
H-415	-1.0610337257385254	I create video games for 10 years now .
H-416	-0.8536534309387207	My goal for the next 10 years is to do that it &apos;s also easy to save the world in the reality that it is in the online games .
H-417	-0.8680852651596069	For this , I have a plan that involves to convince more people , including you , to spend more time to play more big and better games .
H-418	-0.7784861922264099	Today , we spend three billion hours a week to play online .
H-419	-0.5191305875778198	Some here can think , &quot; It &apos;s a lot of time on games . &quot;
H-420	-1.100638747215271	Maybe too , especially in the number of problems to solve in the real world .
H-421	-0.8115108013153076	But in fact , after my research , at the Institute for the center , the reality is exactly the opposite .
H-422	-1.027899980545044	Three billion hours a week are not going to solve the most right problems in the world .
H-423	-1.3663840293884277	In the contrary , I believe that if we want to survive again over the earth , we have to increase this number of times .
H-424	-1.5588116645812988	I calculated that the total needs is 21 billion hours of play a week .
H-425	-1.2998560667037964	It may be a idea of intuitive , so I &apos;m going to be it , let &apos;s look at that much closer .
H-426	-0.7570010423660278	If we want to solve problems like famine , poverty , climate change , conflicts , obesity , I think we need to play to play online at least 21 billion hours in week , over 10 years .
H-427	-0.7835031747817993	If if I &apos;m serious . Really .
H-428	-0.7386329770088196	This is why . This is pretty well why I think the games are also essential for the survival of human species . Really .
H-429	-1.6674458980560303	This is a portrait taken by the photographer disappears .
H-430	-1.159975528717041	He wanted to capture the emotion .
H-431	-1.5688382387161255	For that , he put a camera here in the players while they were doing .
H-432	-0.6407326459884644	This is a classic emotion for a player .
H-433	-1.4086358547210693	If you &apos;re not a player , you could go to the certain of you .
H-434	-0.7433162927627563	You may see the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but especially a intense concentration , very very intense to solve a really difficult problem .
H-435	-1.0515484809875488	If you &apos;re a player , you &apos;ll notice some of you , the glue around your eyes , and around the mouth that is a sign of optimism .
H-436	-2.3682985305786133	The eyebrows gets the surprise .
H-437	-1.3171278238296509	This is a player on the point of living what we call a pink victory .
H-438	-0.9445531964302063	You &apos;ve heard about it . OK .
H-439	-0.865300714969635	So we have some players of us .
H-440	-1.429036021232605	A great victory is a result if positive positive that you don &apos;t even know that it was possible before to reach it .
H-441	-1.1221152544021606	It &apos;s almost beyond the limits of the imagination .
H-442	-1.1378883123397827	When you &apos;ve reached it , you &apos;re shocked to discover what you &apos;re really able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do what you &apos;re really able to be able to be able to do what you &apos;re really able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do what you &apos;re really able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do what you &apos;re really able to be able to be able to be able to do what you &apos;re really able to be able to be able to be able to do what you &apos;re really able to be able to be able to be able to do what you &apos;re really able to be able to be able to do what you &apos;re really able to be able to be able to be able to do what you &apos;re
H-443	-1.6432933807373047	This is a player on the point of a fabulous victory .
H-444	-0.9407655596733093	This is the face that we need to see on millions of people everywhere in the world at the moment where we &apos;re going to get to the problems of the century to come .
H-445	-1.5848551988601685	The face of somebody who , against all , is on the point of a religious victory .
H-446	-1.5714713335037231	Unfortunately , we see this face all the day when we &apos;re looking at the problems .
H-447	-0.6626984477043152	That &apos;s what I call the face , &quot; I don &apos;t like life . &quot;
H-448	-1.383350133895874	This is the mimic . Okay . Okay . All right .
H-449	-1.1927505731582642	It &apos;s still me to have this face .
H-450	-0.7606438994407654	It &apos;s a graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , where I did my Ph.D. , &quot; why are we better in the game that in life ? &quot;
H-451	-0.7345799207687378	It &apos;s a problem that a lot of players have .
H-452	-0.6790041327476501	We think we &apos;re not as good in life than in games .
H-453	-2.100153923034668	Now , not just not say , &quot; Well , that it &apos;s part of it .
H-454	-1.0934208631515503	We get this stage in games . But , but good in the sense of the way to do something that has sense , ready to collaborate and cooperate .
H-455	-1.2598716020584106	When we are in the game , I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , ready to help a eye of eye , ready to tackle it to a problem as long as it will be , to get his failures and then .
H-456	-1.0043586492538452	In the real life , in front of failure , having to obstacles , we &apos;re not often in this state of mind .
H-457	-2.1420512199401855	It &apos;s like out .
H-458	-2.4659810066223145	It &apos;s like away .
H-459	-2.380314350128174	It &apos;s feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or much .
H-460	-0.8679004907608032	We never have these feelings when we play , they don &apos;t just exist .
H-461	-0.6784302592277527	This is what I wanted to study when I was a student in third cycle .
H-462	-1.403115153312683	What are there in the games that do that we think we can be able to be able to do ?
H-463	-1.1420016288757324	How can we take these feelings of play in our everyday work ?
H-464	-1.1807507276535034	I looked at games like the World of Warcraft , which is the archetype of the social resolution of problems .
H-465	-2.1448822021484375	I started to notice of the details that make possible the heroic waves in games .
H-466	-0.8595958352088928	The first idea : at the moment you get in one of these online games , especially in the World of Warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that want to trust you , everything , to make a incredible mission .
H-467	-1.1414700746536255	Not anything , but the one that is perfectly perfectly at your level in the game . OK ?
H-468	-0.6768569946289062	you can do it .
H-469	-1.2573148012161255	They don &apos;t get you a challenge that you can &apos;t get .
H-470	-0.8682357668876648	But one that is at the limit of your capabilities . So you have to work hard .
H-471	-1.3219436407089233	But there &apos;s no jobs in the World of Warcraft .
H-472	-2.1834728717803955	No one is going to turn up the tape .
H-473	-1.3101279735565186	There &apos;s always something that &apos;s accurate and important to do .
H-474	-0.8191827535629272	And also hundreds of collaborators .
H-475	-0.8874959945678711	Where you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to do your own mission .
H-476	-1.7225896120071411	It &apos;s not something at the real life , this feeling that in a range of fingers in the hundreds of collaborators .
H-477	-0.8603366613388062	And also there &apos;s this great story , the story of our lives , and what we do .
H-478	-1.4381884336471558	We all get it positive .
H-479	-1.3548336029052734	You &apos;ve already heard the expressions &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &quot; Leviathan + 1 , &quot; &quot; This + 1 . &quot;
H-480	-0.4806150496006012	We don &apos;t have this kind of information in life .
H-481	-1.8669394254684448	When I &apos;m going to do the stage , I &apos;m not going to be &quot; &quot; A + 1 , &quot; It &apos;s not &quot; A crazy + 1 , &quot; &quot; This crazy + 20 . &quot;
H-482	-0.7551119923591614	I don &apos;t have this back in life .
H-483	-1.8251160383224487	And in the way , the problem with the environments , in the world , as the World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so gratifying to be in the point of the point of a private victory , that we decides to spend all our time in these virtual worlds .
H-484	-0.7100903987884521	It &apos;s just better than reality .
H-485	-1.4297329187393188	In this day , the players of the World of Warcraft have collectively spent a few million years to solve the virtual problems .
H-486	-0.6984461545944214	It &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
H-487	-0.8005828261375427	It can seem the opposite .
H-488	-1.8038274049758911	But it &apos;s doing this in his context : there &apos;s a few million years , our more ancient ancestor was put up up .
H-489	-1.8669883012771606	He was the first part of it .
H-490	-0.9279014468193054	When we &apos;re talking about time we invest in this moment in the games , the only way to address it , or even to think about it , is talking about time at the scale of human evolution , which is a extraordinary thing .
H-491	-1.2429611682891846	But it &apos;s also just . It looks like all this time to play , we keep our human human beings .
H-492	-1.4416557550430298	We &apos;re going to be a larger and honest species .
H-493	-0.6651526093482971	It &apos;s true . I think .
H-494	-1.3693305253982544	So let &apos;s look at this interesting thing .
H-495	-1.2180733680725098	One of the University of Carnegie University , published recently recently .
H-496	-1.3329253196716309	A young way of today in a country in a strong @-@ culture country will spent over 10 hours to play online , at the age of 21 years .
H-497	-1.0658228397369385	Ten hours is a interesting number to two titles .
H-498	-1.135602355003357	First , for the children of the United States , 10 hours is the number of the number of hours of school school , if you &apos;re going to all the course .
H-499	-1.1074000597000122	So there &apos;s a parallel curriculum of education , in course that young people learn the way to become a good player of the same way they learn all the rest of the school .
H-500	-1.3345451354980469	Some here may be read the last book of Malcolm Bonnet . &quot;
H-501	-1.0207312107086182	You &apos;ve probably heard about his theory of success , the theory of 10 hours .
H-502	-1.238338828086853	It &apos;s based on a cognitive science research , &quot; if you spend 10 thousand hours to study anything anything before before 21 years , you &apos;ll be a sign . &quot;
H-503	-1.0370993614196777	You &apos;ll also be good to any other than the best in the world .
H-504	-0.9972410202026367	So , what we &apos;re seeing is a whole generation of young people who are the game of play .
H-505	-1.20759117603302	So the great question is , &quot; What can you use these donations to play ? &quot;
H-506	-1.5537887811660767	If we knew to answer , we would have virtually in hand of human resources without human resources .
H-507	-1.1288996934890747	This is how many people in the world have spent a hour by a day to play online .
H-508	-1.3496787548065186	These are the game of the game .
H-509	-1.0341030359268188	500 million people are good right to something .
H-510	-0.9346864819526672	In the 10 years to come , we &apos;ll have a billion of new players that will be good good to something .
H-511	-0.9827935695648193	In case you don &apos;t know it , it &apos;s going to happen .
H-512	-1.8380494117736816	The industry of the world &apos;s developing @-@ low @-@ consumption and work @-@ working networks in the place of the way , so so in the world of the world , and especially in India , in China , in Brazil , to play online .
H-513	-1.0232090950012207	We expect to a new billion players in 10 years .
H-514	-1.6889901161193848	What &apos;s the number of a billion billion .
H-515	-1.114527702331543	So I started thinking about what these games make us to do .
H-516	-1.596278429031372	Here &apos;s my four conclusions . The first : the optimism is .
H-517	-1.7410606145858765	OK . Imagine this like a kind of extreme .
H-518	-1.567925214767456	The personal optimism is the will going to get up to overcome a obstacle , associated with the certainty of a reasonable hope of order .
H-519	-1.3200315237045288	And the players always believe that a heroic victory is possible , and that it &apos;s worth to try , and try to now .
H-520	-1.4790558815002441	The players don &apos;t sit to do nothing .
H-521	-1.222049355506897	They &apos;re very strong at a very dense social tissue .
H-522	-1.5408990383148193	So , many interesting research show that we love more people after having played with them , even if they &apos;ve been doing us .
H-523	-0.7685321569442749	Why ? Because you have a great trust to play with someone .
H-524	-0.7290213108062744	They &apos;re going to spend time with us , they &apos;re going to play the same rules , with the same goals , they &apos;re going to play until the game is finished .
H-525	-1.134000301361084	So , play together in fact of links , trust and collaboration .
H-526	-1.5749646425247192	The result is that we &apos;re able to make social links .
H-527	-0.513113260269165	A wonderful productivity . I love this idea .
H-528	-1.3714572191238403	You know that there &apos;s a reason that the average player of the World of Warcraft is going on 22 hours a week , a work at the time in a kind of time .
H-529	-1.3735002279281616	It &apos;s because we know , when we play , that we &apos;re actually happier about hard working , that we &apos;re going to go out or it outside .
H-530	-1.352250099182129	We know that the human being is at the way when it &apos;s a hard work , but useful .
H-531	-1.0261969566345215	The players are willing to work hard , all the time , if you get them the right mission .
H-532	-1.261367917060852	And finally , a religious sense .
H-533	-2.7115066051483154	And the love love to see , to have to get up from the bottom missions , from the scale of the planet .
H-534	-1.1546016931533813	A little step to put this in perspective .
H-535	-1.1976033449172974	You all know Wikipedia , the most big century in the world .
H-536	-1.0307376384735107	The second , in the world , with 80 years is the World World World .
H-537	-0.7792500257492065	Five million people use every month .
H-538	-1.5417894124984741	They &apos;ve got more information about the World of Warcraft on the Internet that any other subject that a wiki is wrong .
H-539	-1.4285863637924194	They build a professional story .
H-540	-1.5421438217163086	They build a basic knowledge of knowledge of Warcraft .
H-541	-1.6708167791366577	OK , here &apos;s the four @-@ powers four @-@ powers in a same goal .
H-542	-1.6235531568527222	The players are a lot of hope of hope and well .
H-543	-0.652127206325531	These are people who believe that they can change the world .
H-544	-0.4778737425804138	The only problem is they believe they &apos;re able to change the virtual worlds and not the real world .
H-545	-0.5027406215667725	This is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
H-546	-2.8670029640197754	That &apos;s a economist .
H-547	-0.8363980650901794	His work is impressive . It &apos;s interested in the reasons that grow people to invest as much time , energy and money in online games .
H-548	-1.9293711185455322	He says , &quot; We &apos;re seeing in a event that is a mass @-@ mass @-@ mass and the virtual worlds and the environments of games . &quot;
H-549	-0.8319459557533264	It &apos;s a economist . And so a rational .
H-550	-0.6926642060279846	And he said ,
H-551	-1.3897368907928467	not like me -- I &apos;m a bunch of games , noisy .
H-552	-0.7797324657440186	So he says it &apos;s perfectly logical , because players can make more in the games that in the real world .
H-553	-0.8336784839630127	They can have more strong relationships in the games that in real world .
H-554	-1.1311144828796387	They have a better back and feel more expensive in the games that in real life .
H-555	-1.3031586408615112	That &apos;s why it &apos;s now that it &apos;s currently logical that the players spend more time in line that in the real world .
H-556	-1.3746713399887085	I think , I find this all as rational , right .
H-557	-0.9682255983352661	But it &apos;s not , in no case , a common situation .
H-558	-0.9822594523429871	We need to start to make the real world more close to play .
H-559	-1.7937499284744263	I &apos;ve been inspired in a event event there &apos;s 2,500 years ago .
H-560	-1.7151081562042236	This are the old @-@ old , made out of sheep . OK ?
H-561	-2.0001749992370605	Before these wonderful piece of play , they have a sheep of sheep .
H-562	-2.1039421558380127	They represent the first few game of play in human beings .
H-563	-0.8176621794700623	If you &apos;re familiar with the work of the Greek historian , you know , you may have this story .
H-564	-0.6554067134857178	The story of which invented the game and why .
H-565	-2.093384265899658	It was saying that games , especially the dice , have been been invented in the bottom of it for a famine .
H-566	-1.4797037839889526	Apparently , famine was so serious that the king of the Taliban decided that they had to do something .
H-567	-2.223635673522949	People were . They &apos;re going to grow .
H-568	-1.7124959230422974	The situation was terrible . They needed a very good solution .
H-569	-2.0790560245513916	In the way , they &apos;re going to get them , and they &apos;re doing a law in all the ocean .
H-570	-0.42609721422195435	The first day , everybody could eat .
H-571	-0.7323718667030334	The next day , everybody had to play .
H-572	-1.6465855836868286	They would be so focused on their game game -- games are so heavy and we put into a very special productivity , that they &apos;re doing that they didn &apos;t have to eat .
H-573	-1.1138609647750854	And so , the next day , they were playing .
H-574	-0.9727513194084167	And the next day , they eat .
H-575	-1.575011968612671	On the way , 18 years ago , they &apos;re going to famine , they &apos;re going to be a day , and playing the next day .
H-576	-0.45042097568511963	I think it &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re doing today .
H-577	-1.2836652994155884	We play to save the suffering of the world .
H-578	-1.0937756299972534	We play to move out of what doesn &apos;t go in the real life , everything that &apos;s not good , and we get the game that we need .
H-579	-0.8519357442855835	But we don &apos;t have to stop us here .
H-580	-0.3905161917209625	It &apos;s really interesting .
H-581	-1.230570912361145	In the way , after 18 years , famine was always present . So , the king decided that they were doing a last time .
H-582	-1.8028485774993896	They &apos;re going to be the kingdom in two .
H-583	-1.8003630638122559	They &apos;re going to take a time , and the winners would be right to their private adventure .
H-584	-1.444848895072937	They &apos;re going to be the way , and to be a new place to live , leaving the number of people can live on the resources available , and hoping to move their civilization to a place where it could be thrive .
H-585	-1.0200629234313965	It sounds incredible , right ?
H-586	-1.4352169036865234	But recently , DNA evidence showed that the ones , who led to the Ottoman Empire , share in fact the same DNA that the ancient elders .
H-587	-1.155007004737854	Recently , scientists have suggested that the incredible story of it is actually true .
H-588	-1.4771140813827515	Things found the evidence of a global cooling that has been about 20 years that could explain the famine .
H-589	-0.7285324931144714	This amazing story could be true .
H-590	-1.3536776304244995	They could actually have saved their culture in playing , in the game for 18 years , then as inspired , and knowing if well how to be healthy by the game that they &apos;re doing their civilization .
H-591	-0.4567641019821167	We also , we can do it .
H-592	-2.21273136138916	We &apos;re starting to write since in 1994 .
H-593	-1.1217551231384277	It was the first game of strategy in real time of the series of Warcraft . It was 16 years back .
H-594	-1.738974690437317	They played to the world for 18 years , we &apos;re playing to Warcraft for 16 years .
H-595	-1.2028353214263916	I think we &apos;re willing to be ready for our positive game .
H-596	-1.0349632501602173	They shared their civilization in two to come to the research of a new world .
H-597	-1.1174858808517456	This is how I come to my 21 billion hours of play a week .
H-598	-1.3273283243179321	We need half of us to spend a hour a day to play , until we get real problems .
H-599	-1.031551480293274	I know you tell you , &quot; How do we get to solve real problems in playing ? &quot; Well , this is what I &apos;ve got my work in the last few years , at the Institute for the face .
H-600	-1.970362901687622	We &apos;ve got this nightmare in our offices to Palo Alto , and it &apos;s going to be our way to address the future .
H-601	-0.3814249336719513	We don &apos;t want to try to predict the future .
H-602	-0.9324670433998108	What we want is to invent the future .
H-603	-0.8556840419769287	We want to imagine the best result possible . And we want to do all the world to make this real outcome .
H-604	-1.868278980255127	And we want to illustrate the heroic helix , and give people the ways of order to do one .
H-605	-1.0655971765518188	I &apos;m going to show you quickly three games that I &apos;ve been able to get to give people the ways to create this victory in their own future .
H-606	-1.3405956029891968	This is the World .
H-607	-0.7241324186325073	We invented it in 2007 .
H-608	-1.2741156816482544	It &apos;s a online game in which you &apos;re trying to survive with a lack of essence .
H-609	-1.338244915008545	The essence of essence is it , but we &apos;ve got enough enough content for that you think it &apos;s true and for the living as it was more gasoline . When you start the game , you &apos;re going to tell you , you &apos;re telling you where you live .
H-610	-1.5543007850646973	And then you get a real time in real time , the son of information that are showing you how much exactly the essence of the essence , which is , how the food production is affected , how the transportation are , if the schools are , if there are riots .
H-611	-0.9658701419830322	You &apos;ve got to get you to live your real life as if this was true . And we ask you to tell you , to send videos , pictures .
H-612	-1.3950326442718506	We &apos;ve got this game with 40 players in 2007 .
H-613	-0.9935353994369507	We follow them for three years .
H-614	-1.3550381660461426	I can tell you that it &apos;s a experiment that will affect you .
H-615	-0.6657058596611023	Nobody wants to change his life of life to improve the world , or because we should do it .
H-616	-1.2642643451690674	But if you &apos;re getting you in a private adventure and hear : &quot; We don &apos;t have more gasoline . &quot;
H-617	-0.6508608460426331	It becomes a extraordinary story and a adventure to live .
H-618	-1.3268969058990479	Do you want to see how you &apos;re doing .
H-619	-1.4720690250396729	Most of the players have become the fundamental habits in this game .
H-620	-1.0751316547393799	So , for the next game where we save the world , we decided to make a more flexible problem , more bigger than the lack of gasoline .
H-621	-1.5357837677001953	We &apos;ve created the game . &quot;
H-622	-1.0922398567199707	The subject was : a super @-@ computer has calculated that humans had more than 23 years to live on Earth .
H-623	-2.47664737701416	And this computer is called the System of which &apos;s looking of the warm , of course , of course .
H-624	-1.429083228111267	We asked people to come out like a film of Jerry Jerry .
H-625	-0.9566805958747864	You know his movies , you &apos;ll see a team of dream .
H-626	-1.0891649723052979	There &apos;s the astronaut , the scientist , the former prisoner , each one has his mission to save the world .
H-627	-0.5555651187896729	But in our game , instead of having five people in the team , we say that everybody &apos;s going on , your mission is to invent the energy of the future , the future of the future , the future of the future , the future of the future and social protection of the future .
H-628	-0.9780332446098328	There are 60,000 people who have played for eight weeks .
H-629	-1.7158498764038086	They &apos;ve imagined 500 different solutions that you can find on the Internet , and in Google .
H-630	-1.0170303583145142	Finally , the last game . We have it the three March . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank Institute .
H-631	-1.8390854597091675	If you end the game , you &apos;re going to be designed by the World Bank , as it &apos;s a couple of time , like 2010 .
H-632	-1.1825056076049805	We &apos;re working with universities in the sub @-@ Saharan Africa . We have them to acquire skills in social innovation .
H-633	-1.3373500108718872	There &apos;s a comic bandwidth , different levels in local studies , the network of knowledge , sustainability , vision and resource .
H-634	-0.7006697654724121	I &apos;d like to ask you to share this game with young world , especially in the developing areas , which could benefit from this collaboration to start to imagine their own social companies to save the world .
H-635	-1.5392892360687256	I &apos;m going to get a little bit .
H-636	-0.43182167410850525	I have a question .
H-637	-0.6715454459190369	What do you think it &apos;s going to happen ?
H-638	-0.7752013206481934	There are all these incredible players , there are these games that are using pilots from what we could do , but none of them has still saved the world .
H-639	-0.8075246810913086	Well , I hope you &apos;ll agree with me to say that players are an efficient resource to do tasks in the real world , that games are a powerful way for change .
H-640	-1.3138891458511353	We all have these great amazing powers , this wonderful productivity , the possibility of making a solid social link , this sense of an personal optimism , and the desire of a religious sense to our lives .
H-641	-0.9542557001113892	I really hope that we &apos;re going to bring us to play with useful games , to survive 100 years on this planet .
H-642	-1.1469535827636719	My wish is that you get me to create games and play .
H-643	-0.8558306097984314	When I look at 10 years to come , I &apos;m sure about two things : we can create any future we &apos;re thinking , and we can play the games that we want .
H-644	-1.7603020668029785	What the games are going to be the world start .
H-645	-0.5641671419143677	Thank you . I &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate .
H-646	-1.2888222932815552	And it can seem a little bit surprising because my work at time in the Foundation is rather more vaccines and the seeds , the things that we have to invent and get to help the two billion the poorest billion to live better .
H-647	-0.5073418617248535	But energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than for anyone on the planet .
H-648	-1.278611660003662	The climate climate , which means that there will be a lot of years where their cultures don &apos;t get .
H-649	-0.8027842044830322	There will be too much rain , or not enough rain .
H-650	-1.0726009607315063	The things are going to evolve in directions that their fragile environment can &apos;t just support .
H-651	-0.5378868579864502	And this leads to famine . It leads to uncertainty . It leads to disorders .
H-652	-0.6704912781715393	The climate changes will be terrible for them .
H-653	-0.5546805262565613	The price of energy , also , is very important for them .
H-654	-0.9286158680915833	In fact , if you couldn &apos;t get the price that a single thing , to reduce poverty , it would be , from far , the energy of energy .
H-655	-1.0690727233886719	Now , the price of energy has taken to the time .
H-656	-1.2018111944198608	Really , the civilization of civilization are based on the energy of energy .
H-657	-1.1833499670028687	The revolution of coal has taken the industrial revolution , and , even in the &apos; 1900s , we &apos;ve got to a very fast level of the price of electricity , and it &apos;s because we have helium , air air , that we can make modern materials and make a lot of things .
H-658	-1.1721006631851196	In the rich world , it &apos;s going to be in electricity .
H-659	-1.6431705951690674	But , at the same time that we &apos;re eating its price -- and it &apos;s gone to the divide by two -- we have to answer a new firm , and that &apos;s going to be the CO2 .
H-660	-0.814963161945343	The CO2 goes to the planet , and the equation on CO2 is actually very simple .
H-661	-1.0346988439559937	If you take the total CO2 of CO2 , it leads to a temperature of temperature , and that increase temperature leads to very negative effects .
H-662	-0.988350510597229	The effects on the weather and , maybe worse , the significant effects , because the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to these fast changes , and then we see the collapse of these ecosystems .
H-663	-1.4283932447433472	It &apos;s true that on the numbers , what temperature we will be , from what CO2 increase , and what we will be positive effects , there , you have a certain uncertainty , but not a lot .
H-664	-0.8340044021606445	And if we don &apos;t know exactly the degree of gravity of these effects , we know that they will be extremely serious .
H-665	-1.5503474473953247	At several times , I asked the high @-@ level scientists if it had to go down to close to zero ?
H-666	-1.6699116230010986	Can we don &apos;t have any than half of half of half or quarter ?
H-667	-1.1045441627502441	And the answer is that , until we &apos;re looking at zero , temperature will continue to increase .
H-668	-0.5610489249229431	And so it &apos;s a big challenge .
H-669	-1.1313507556915283	It &apos;s very different than say that you &apos;re a high @-@ foot truck truck trying to move under a three @-@ foot bridge , and we &apos;re going to find the way to go up .
H-670	-0.8884567022323608	This is something that has to get to zero .
H-671	-0.7738502621650696	Every year , we &apos;re looking at a big amount of CO2 , over 26 billion tons of tons .
H-672	-0.8615240454673767	For every American , it &apos;s about 20 tons .
H-673	-0.9659321308135986	For a decade of a poor country , it &apos;s less than a ton .
H-674	-0.5210486054420471	The average is about five tons per person on the planet .
H-675	-0.9234297275543213	And we have to find the way to bring the changes to go down to zero .
H-676	-1.0753706693649292	The increase was constant .
H-677	-1.3955808877944946	It &apos;s just because of various economic changes that it &apos;s slowed down , so we have to spend a quick rise to a decline , to go down to zero .
H-678	-0.5805551409721375	This equation has four factors .
H-679	-1.2490758895874023	Let &apos;s take a little bit of them .
H-680	-0.9177886843681335	Now , we have something on the left , the CO2 , that you want to reduce zero , and it &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services that every person uses , in average , the energy used in average for every service , and the CO2 is , by unit of energy .
H-681	-0.9423362612724304	So , let &apos;s look at each of these members , and see how you can reduce the result of zero .
H-682	-1.2583109140396118	It will probably be that one of these numbers is just close to zero .
H-683	-1.536311388015747	It &apos;s the level of the front of the side of the side , but let &apos;s take a look at it .
H-684	-0.7167888283729553	First of us have the population .
H-685	-1.6359844207763672	The world is going to be a lot of people .
H-686	-1.0803250074386597	We should get the nine billion .
H-687	-1.1399424076080322	With very good results on new vaccines , health care , the control control , you might be the reduce , maybe , 10 or 15 percent , but you have a factor of about about 1.3 .
H-688	-0.6520023941993713	The second factor of the services that we use .
H-689	-1.4476292133331299	It &apos;s going to get everything , the food that we eat , clothes , television , television .
H-690	-0.7245451807975769	These are very good things , and get rid of poverty means to provide these services to almost all the world on the planet .
H-691	-0.9514229893684387	And it &apos;s a good thing that this number increases .
H-692	-1.332757830619812	In the rich world , maybe the billion of the top , we could probably have reduce them , but every year , this number , in average , will go up , and will get more than double the number of services .
H-693	-1.1142680644989014	Here we have a very basic example of service .
H-694	-1.0484681129455566	You &apos;ve got home a lighting lighting to read and do the French homework . Not these children . So they come out and do their homework at the light of the street .
H-695	-0.5320459604263306	Now , efficiency , &quot; E , the amount of energy for every service , and here , we finally have good news .
H-696	-1.191833257675171	We have something that &apos;s not moving .
H-697	-0.6842049956321716	Through various inventions and new ways to do light , through new types of cars , different ways of building buildings .
H-698	-1.2675060033798218	There &apos;s a lot of services that you can reduce the energy of the way , and for some different services , the reducing to 90 percent .
H-699	-1.3889585733413696	There are other services like the way to make the fertilizers , or to make the transportation transportation , where the improvement of improvement are a lot more .
H-700	-1.2740561962127686	And so , basically , in being optimistic , you could get a three @-@ dimensional factor of three to three , maybe even , a six @-@ factor factor .
H-701	-1.1126182079315186	For the whole three of these three factors , we &apos;re at the best in 26 billion billion , maybe 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s not enough .
H-702	-1.0274218320846558	So , let &apos;s see this fourth factor -- which is going to be a key factor -- and it &apos;s the amount of CO2 , a energy unit .
H-703	-0.6717492938041687	And so , the question is , &quot; Can you reduce it to zero ? &quot;
H-704	-1.0410770177841187	In coal of coal , the answer is not .
H-705	-1.0122159719467163	If you get the natural gas , not more .
H-706	-1.250819444656372	Almost all the techniques to produce the power of electricity , outside energy and nuclear energy , reducing CO2 .
H-707	-0.6633427739143372	And so , what we &apos;re going to have to make a global scale , which is to create a new system .
H-708	-1.1066386699676514	So , we need miracles in the field of energy .
H-709	-0.3867109715938568	But when I use the word miracle , I don &apos;t want to say something impossible .
H-710	-0.7691148519515991	The microprocessor is a miracle . The computer computer is a miracle .
H-711	-0.6218103766441345	The Internet and the web services are a miracle .
H-712	-1.1147518157958984	In this sense , people are going to be in the creation of many miracles .
H-713	-1.7498023509979248	So , we don &apos;t have to be a school , where you have to do the miracle for a given date .
H-714	-1.6339253187179565	In fact , we &apos;re just going to be ready , and then some of them happen , other .
H-715	-1.2142105102539062	In the case , it &apos;s going to go to the speed and get a miracle with a fairly painful calendar .
H-716	-1.5713731050491333	I asked me how I could summarize it with this .
H-717	-1.1504493951797485	Is there a kind of illustration from nature , a demonstration that is the imagination of people here ?
H-718	-1.4356763362884521	I &apos;ve been looking at the last year , when I had brought the mosquitoes , people had good loved .
H-719	-0.9983930587768555	It allowed them to really integrate the idea that there are people who live with the mosquitoes .
H-720	-1.0868102312088013	So , with energy , all what I could get , it &apos;s that .
H-721	-1.2896785736083984	I decided to have the free of the fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here , this year .
H-722	-1.5337978601455688	So here &apos;s the natural constraints .
H-723	-1.2904410362243652	We told me that they don &apos;t do , in fact , they could not leave this pot .
H-724	-1.1515487432479858	There are all kinds of expensive solutions like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot of it , actually .
H-725	-1.2898225784301758	We need one or many solutions , which work at a huge scale , with a huge speed , and , although we &apos;re looking for a lot of directions , I really see the five of the road .
H-726	-2.6520421504974365	I let left the energy energy , to do , we know , fusion .
H-727	-1.1196911334991455	They get their contribution , and if it &apos;s more than I don &apos;t think , so better , but my idea there is that on these five @-@ there , there &apos;s still work to do , and we can &apos;t leave it , even if it seems to be , even if the challenges to seem to be important .
H-728	-1.2312288284301758	Let &apos;s look at the fuel of fossil fuels , that it is the coal or natural gas .
H-729	-1.4257563352584839	What you need to do there simple , but it &apos;s not , it &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after the combustion , the turn out of the circuit , put it into pressure , to put it up , put it somewhere , and hope there &apos;s there .
H-730	-1.064165472984314	There are advanced projects to do that in 60 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s to 100 percent , it will be very tricky , and it will be hard from the place where all this CO2 should be put , but the most hard is here the question of the long term .
H-731	-1.5562525987625122	Who can have this certainty ?
H-732	-0.9613720178604126	Who can make something that is billions of times more than any other type of waste that you can think , nuclear or other ?
H-733	-0.7517006397247314	It &apos;s a lot of volume .
H-734	-0.7869865894317627	So it will be hard for this solution .
H-735	-0.7904443144798279	Then , there &apos;s nuclear .
H-736	-1.6731252670288086	Who also have three big problems .
H-737	-1.312037706375122	The cost , in particular countries , is high .
H-738	-0.982231616973877	The question of security , to be really sure that there will be no problem , that , even in human operators , the fuel is not used for weapons .
H-739	-1.0120773315429688	And then , what do with the waste ?
H-740	-1.2556027173995972	And , although the volume is not not very well , it &apos;s a lot of problems .
H-741	-1.2108893394470215	People need to feel good there .
H-742	-0.8775458335876465	So , three very difficult problems that could be solved , and so , on which it would have to work .
H-743	-1.1685184240341187	The last three of the five , I &apos;ve got them .
H-744	-1.6173418760299683	These are the people that people are often reference as the energy energy .
H-745	-1.2803928852081299	But in fact -- even if it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t have any fuel -- they &apos;re going to have a few bit .
H-746	-1.263122320175171	The first is that the density of energy produced through these technologies is extremely lower to the power of a electric power .
H-747	-1.0665141344070435	It &apos;s about energy , we &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of times more space than for a normal energy power .
H-748	-1.7499938011169434	So , the more thing are a lot of a @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ ,
H-749	-1.187564730644226	The sun isn &apos;t going to all the day , it doesn &apos;t have all every day , and , in course , the wind doesn &apos;t breath all the time .
H-750	-0.8182539939880371	And so , if you &apos;re making these sources , you have to have a way to get energy for these time of time where it &apos;s not available .
H-751	-1.382372498512268	We have here about big problems of costs .
H-752	-1.3267219066619873	We have some problems of transmission .
H-753	-0.8821130990982056	For example , say that this energy source is outside of your country , so not only you need technology , but you need to face the risk of a energy came of elsewhere .
H-754	-0.7122639417648315	And finally , there &apos;s this problem problem .
H-755	-0.9532573223114014	So , for that , I studied all the kinds of batteries that we &apos;re doing , for cars , for computers , phones , mobile lights , for all , and compared this to the amount of power energy used in the world , and what I &apos;ve found is that the entire data that we do today could be less than 10 minutes of the energy .
H-756	-0.7909610271453857	So , in fact , we need a important breakthrough here , something that can improve a factor of 100 of the approaches we have now .
H-757	-0.3585677444934845	It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
H-758	-0.9663509726524353	That &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing when we try to get a more more source , say , 20 to 30 percent of what we use .
H-759	-1.062018632888794	If you think about this source to provide 100 percent , you need a incredible miracle battery .
H-760	-0.8762888312339783	Well , let &apos;s try to move on the question of the good approach to adopt .
H-761	-1.4853435754776	Is it a new Project Project ? &quot; What means to happen ?
H-762	-0.7728515863418579	Well , we need a lot of companies to work about the subject , hundreds .
H-763	-0.8719552755355835	In each of these five lanes , we need at least a hundred people .
H-764	-0.5480145215988159	And for many of them , you think they &apos;re crazy . It &apos;s perfect .
H-765	-1.0635027885437012	And , I think here , in the TED group , a lot of people are going to have these lanes .
H-766	-2.0963332653045654	Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know a couple of new technologies .
H-767	-1.6110798120498657	And it &apos;s going to be able to have a lot of companies that are great things and have some possibilities , and I try to help to support these projects .
H-768	-1.3382197618484497	In fact , Nathan and me , we &apos;re going to become a society that , that you can be , has chosen nuclear approach .
H-769	-1.1488066911697388	There are a few innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
H-770	-1.1774498224258423	And the innovation had really moved in this industry since a certain time , so , the idea that there &apos;s a few ideas that is not surprising .
H-771	-1.101914644241333	The idea of it is , instead of burn a part of uranium , this one percent , which is the way , we decided to burn the other 99 percent , the way .
H-772	-0.7726953625679016	It &apos;s a little crazy idea .
H-773	-1.1674926280975342	In fact , it was a long time that people were talking about , but they were never going to simulate properly if it would work or not , so it &apos;s thanks to the advent of super @-@ modern computers that we could do the simulation , and see that , yes , with the right approach on materials , it seems that it can work .
H-774	-1.1259347200393677	And , because you get these 99 percent , you &apos;ve got a lot of the cost of costs .
H-775	-1.3698772192001343	And what you &apos;re doing , these are waste , and you can use as fuel all the waste of waste waste by the reactors of today .
H-776	-1.0319803953170776	So instead of worry about their subject , we use them . It &apos;s something .
H-777	-1.6108723878860474	It &apos;s going to take this uranium in a bit . It &apos;s a little bit like a candle .
H-778	-1.5300331115722656	You can see this as a note , we &apos;ve often talked about like the waves of waves . &quot;
H-779	-0.8788822293281555	In terms of fuel , it really makes the problem .
H-780	-0.5877301692962646	I have a picture here from a place in Kentucky .
H-781	-1.4797123670578003	These are the &quot; remains , &quot; The 99 percent , which we &apos;ve taken all the part of the part of the part of the part , then we call it &quot; uranium . &quot;
H-782	-0.9968757629394531	It would make the United States for hundreds of years .
H-783	-1.207431435585022	And , by a little expensive process , just by basically the sea water we have enough fuel for all the rest of the rest of the planet .
H-784	-0.8422722220420837	Okay , there &apos;s still a lot of path to do , but it &apos;s a example of hundreds of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas we need to move .
H-785	-1.5903184413909912	So , how are we going to make us our scale scale ?
H-786	-1.4153802394866943	What should you look at the road on the road ?
H-787	-1.214959979057312	Let &apos;s start by the goal that we have to reach , and then let &apos;s look at the steps .
H-788	-0.5514140725135803	For 2050 , you &apos;ve heard a lot of people talk about this 80 percent percent .
H-789	-1.1504963636398315	It &apos;s really very important that we could do .
H-790	-0.8298940062522888	And the 20 percent of what &apos;s happening in the poor countries , or a little bit of agriculture .
H-791	-2.3785297870635986	So what we &apos;re going to have a sneakers and a industry of the cement .
H-792	-1.1214154958724976	So , to get to these 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , have to transform their methods of electricity production .
H-793	-1.0706499814987183	The next level , it will be going to put this zero @-@ show technology , to get it in all the developed countries and to be going to do it in the other countries .
H-794	-0.641126811504364	It &apos;s great important .
H-795	-1.0075503587722778	It &apos;s a essential element to hold the sheet of the road .
H-796	-1.4220818281173706	So , back back back from there , what looks like the sheet of 2020 ?
H-797	-0.6652722954750061	Well , again , we should have two elements .
H-798	-1.5710887908935547	We need to go through efficiency of efficiency to start to get out of them .
H-799	-1.232888102531433	Less ourselves , less large will be the CO2 of CO2 , and , by therefore , less hot will be the temperature .
H-800	-1.682891845703125	But in some ways , the level that we &apos;re getting here , by doing things that don &apos;t get all of a lot of important , is not more important , and maybe even less , that this other , which is innovation on which that are going to do these .
H-801	-1.891091227531433	These progress , we need to get them at all speed , and we can quantify this in terms of societies , high projects , and that &apos;s a lot of the world .
H-802	-1.0906100273132324	A lot of great books have been written about this .
H-803	-1.3335174322128296	The book of Al Gore , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the book of David means , &quot; The sustainable energy without hot . &quot;
H-804	-1.1445876359939575	They really understand the subject , and create a framework that opens out of the discussion , because we need a large support for this .
H-805	-0.9566474556922913	A lot of things have to happen in the same time .
H-806	-0.7372167110443115	So this is a wish .
H-807	-1.4034364223480225	It &apos;s a very nice wish , that we get this technology .
H-808	-1.3118966817855835	If you gave me a single wish to do for the next 50 years , if I could choose the next president , or choose a vaccine , which is something I like , or even choose that this thing was invented , a cost @-@ cost cost , a cost @-@ cost cost , is that last one than I was going to be .
H-809	-0.9153255224227905	This is the most big impact .
H-810	-0.6856341361999512	If this wish don &apos;t realize , the division between people who think about short term and long term will be terrible , between the United States and China , between poor countries and countries , and life will be much worse for most of these two billion people .
H-811	-0.6784180998802185	So what do we do ?
H-812	-1.0183271169662476	What do I call you to go to the before ?
H-813	-1.207553505897522	It takes more funding for research .
H-814	-0.8938482403755188	When the country are together , like Copenhagen , they should not talk about CO2 .
H-815	-1.7279764413833618	They should talk about this innovation program , and you would be able to be a very low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ low @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@
H-816	-1.3351224660873413	We need incentives for the market , a CO2 of CO2 , with it and exchange , something that activates a price signal .
H-817	-1.0313044786453247	We need to do the message .
H-818	-0.8542890548706055	We need it to become more rational , more understandable , including the steps , the measurements that the government takes .
H-819	-0.4233241677284241	It &apos;s a important wish , but I think we can do it .
H-820	-0.1301618367433548	Thank you .
H-821	-0.1301618367433548	Thank you .
H-822	-0.6739400625228882	I thank you . Thank you .
H-823	-1.0846136808395386	Thank you . Just better to understand , about the way , I mean , all of all , can you give a idea of the amount of the investments that this represents ?
H-824	-1.183406949043274	To make the software with Bangladesh , hire the best scientists , what we &apos;ve done , it was only only in tens of millions of millions , and even in having our materials in a hot reactor to make sure that they work properly , we &apos;re only in the hundreds of millions of million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million .
H-825	-1.4897139072418213	The most hard is the building of the pilot &apos;s building , find the few billion , find the way , the location this is how we &apos;re going to do the first one .
H-826	-1.148870825767517	Once the first will be built , if it works as well , so it will be a matter , with economic data and energy density , so many of the nuclear power that we know .
H-827	-1.060822606086731	So , for order to understand , it involves building , deep in the ground , something like a kind of a nuclear column of nuclear fuel , made from this uranium , and then the process starts by the top and continues to the bottom ?
H-828	-1.409977674484253	It &apos;s that . Today , we &apos;ve got to look at the reactor in fuel , so it requires a lot of people and a lot of people can be going to turn , as when you have to open it , and get to go and get things .
H-829	-0.46318453550338745	It &apos;s not good .
H-830	-1.4389621019363403	But if we have a very cheap fuel that we can put to 60 years -- think there &apos;s just like a own -- the ask there without having all these same complex problems .
H-831	-1.210191249847412	It &apos;s there , it &apos;s going to burn for the 60 years and then it &apos;s finished .
H-832	-1.0284059047698975	It &apos;s a nuclear power that is its own solution of waste waste .
H-833	-0.6909112930297852	Yes . Well , what &apos;s happening with the waste is that you can leave them on -- there &apos;s a lot of waste with this approach -- and then you can get them , put them into another reactor and burn everything .
H-834	-1.6038357019424438	In fact , we &apos;ll start with the waste that exist today , which are in these pools of cooling , and close to the reactor .
H-835	-1.0454521179199219	It &apos;s that , the fuel with which we start .
H-836	-1.6432713270187378	What was a problem with the reactors of reactors , that &apos;s what the ours is , and we &apos;re reduced the volume of waste with this process .
H-837	-1.0620906352996826	But when you talk about people around you , in the world , the possibilities that we have here , where do we be the more interest to actually do something ?
H-838	-1.2198196649551392	Well , we have not chosen particular place , and there &apos;s all these rules of motion about all that &apos;s in nuclear , so we &apos;re so much of interest , and the society sent people in Russia , India , China .
H-839	-1.8243643045425415	I went to see the Secretary of the end here , talking about how it &apos;s going on the energy agenda .
H-840	-0.7113762497901917	I &apos;m optimistic . You know that the French and the Japanese did the good job .
H-841	-1.5291640758514404	And it &apos;s one of something that has already been done .
H-842	-1.0605227947235107	It &apos;s a important progress , but it &apos;s like a quick reactor , and many countries already built , so every one of those is candidate to be the first country where we turn the first one .
H-843	-1.4363387823104858	What are , according to you , the best and the probability of making this right in the reality ?
H-844	-1.1172778606414795	Well , for one of these large @-@ scale @-@ scale production , and it &apos;s just a approximation , we have to count 20 year to invent , and 20 years to put it .
H-845	-1.4506745338439941	It &apos;s at this kind of view that the environmental models we showed that he needed to wait .
H-846	-1.1820170879364014	And , you know , you know , if the things are going to be good , which is a lot of hope , could be able to hold these time .
H-847	-1.2828071117401123	And there &apos;s fortunately , today , tens of companies , and you need to have hundreds of hundreds , which will be , if the scientific side of a lot , and if the funding of their pilots are going on , in the competition .
H-848	-1.1480917930603027	And it will be better if we &apos;re looking at several success , because we can use a mixture of this .
H-849	-1.6608061790466309	It needs to be a one of these research projects .
H-850	-1.184203863143921	In terms of changes the rules of the high @-@ scale game , is it the most important that you &apos;ve heard about ?
H-851	-0.7107056975364685	A breakthrough in the field of energy is the most important thing .
H-852	-1.4679663181304932	It would have been , even without the environment of the environment , but the environmental Society is just so much more important .
H-853	-0.6261069774627686	In the nuclear field , there are other innovators .
H-854	-1.116792917251587	You know , we don &apos;t know as much of their work that this is , but there are those who study the approach by modules , it &apos;s a different approach .
H-855	-1.0793336629867554	There &apos;s the kind of liquid type , which seems a little bit difficult , but it &apos;s perhaps what they also thought about us .
H-857	-0.8833276629447937	And if it doesn &apos;t work , what do you do ?
H-858	-1.0275664329528809	Do we start to take the urgency of urgency to try to keep stable the temperature of the earth ?
H-859	-0.9044479727745056	If you come into this situation , it would be like if you had too eaten , and you were ready to have a ticket .
H-860	-0.7115083336830139	So , where do you go ? You need a heart surgery or something like this .
H-861	-1.3331106901168823	There &apos;s a research line on what we call the engineering @-@ engineering @-@ engineering , looking at different techniques , which will make the warming , to win the 20 or 30 years necessary to take us in hand .
H-862	-0.9902752041816711	It &apos;s nothing more than a insurance police .
H-863	-1.041003704071045	We don &apos;t need to need it .
H-864	-1.0415730476379395	Some people say he wouldn &apos;t even have to work in this direction , because it could be going to make us , as if you &apos;re going to eat because you know that heart surgery will be there to save you .
H-865	-1.1597583293914795	I &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s not , being given the problem of the problem , but , right , there &apos;s this story of engineering @-@ engineering story , to keep the bottom of the pocket , in case , where things get more faster than it , or that innovation is a lot more slow .
H-866	-1.1636749505996704	Now , you know , if you had a two or two sentences to tell them , how could you persuade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
H-867	-0.7519823312759399	Well , unfortunately , the climbers are in different camps .
H-868	-1.4415653944015503	The ones that the arguments are scientists are very many .
H-869	-1.6506799459457397	And what are the effects of negative feedback that have to see with the clouds that are on the things ?
H-870	-0.8205047845840454	There &apos;s very , very little things that they can even say , there &apos;s a chance on a million for this .
H-871	-0.8215590715408325	The main problem that we have here is a little bit like AIDS .
H-872	-0.842011034488678	You do a mistake now , and you pay the price a lot later .
H-873	-1.3536330461502075	When you don &apos;t have any kind of one problem , this idea of order now , with a more later -- with a pain that we &apos;re not sure .
H-874	-1.0408869981765747	In fact , the report of experts &apos;s about experts , it &apos;s not necessarily the worst of the case , and there are people in the rich countries that look at it and say , &quot; Okay , it &apos;s not so important . &quot;
H-875	-0.960637629032135	The fact is that it &apos;s this part of uncertainty that should grow us in this direction .
H-876	-1.018571138381958	But my dream is that , if you can do that it &apos;s economic , and answer the CO2 constraints , then the skeptical will say , &quot; OK , it &apos;s not going to get no CO2 , I would have a lot of the CO2 of CO2 , but I think I &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s better market .
H-877	-0.912520170211792	And then , it would be your answer to the argument of the argument , that , if we &apos;re spending all this energy to try to solve the problem of CO2 , it &apos;s going to take it all the other goals , like trying to get the world of poverty and malaria , etc , so that &apos;s a stupid waste of resources that to spend money for that , when there &apos;s much better to do .
H-878	-1.540968656539917	Well , the world actually actually go in R &amp; amp -- say , if the United States in 10 billion more per year than now -- it wouldn &apos;t be so dramatic .
H-879	-1.9847793579101562	It &apos;s not going to get the other people in the cause .
H-880	-1.3245753049850464	Now , where people are doing can not be right , and we &apos;re talking about here , it &apos;s when you have something not economic , and you try to fund it .
H-881	-0.9496744275093079	It &apos;s mostly that , for me , which is a waste .
H-882	-0.7749500274658203	Except if we &apos;re very close to the solution , and what we &apos;re finance is the progression of knowledge , and that it &apos;s going to be very good market .
H-883	-0.9359964728355408	I think we should try more things that might be , potentially , more more expensive .
H-884	-1.8715697526931763	If you get it that you &apos;re doing , it &apos;s a great expensive energy , &quot; then only the rich can allow it .
H-885	-0.8467124700546265	What I mean is that we all , here , we could allow us to pay our five times more expensive , without change our life .
H-886	-0.5938726663589478	The disaster would be for these two billion people .
H-887	-1.402610421180725	And even though has changed .
H-888	-1.519760251045227	His thing , now , this is to repeat , &quot; why don &apos;t you get more R @-@ D R . &quot;
H-889	-1.245801329612732	It &apos;s still , because of the business of before , always associated with the camp camp , but it understood that it &apos;s a pretty radical position , then he goes out his thing of R &amp; D .
H-890	-0.7818732857704163	But there &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t seem to be wrong .
H-891	-1.8801466226577759	It &apos;s crazy to see how the R &amp; D is a little bit about it .
H-892	-0.808449923992157	Well , Bill , I think I &apos;m talking about the name of most people here in saying that I really hope that your wish becomes reality . Thank you very much .
H-893	-0.91758131980896	I thank you . I &apos;ve known many fish , in my life .
H-894	-1.4151309728622437	There &apos;s only two that I &apos;ve been doing .
H-895	-1.2191241979599	With the first one , it was kind of a passionate relationship .
H-896	-1.5093307495117188	It was a beautiful fish , a lot , a @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ ,
H-897	-1.656823754310608	What &apos;s fish .
H-898	-1.1400669813156128	And again , it was supposed to be high by the most high standards of sustainability .
H-899	-2.291317939758301	What does that in the selling , it was a lot of it .
H-900	-0.8549073338508606	I was a relationship with this beauty for several months .
H-901	-1.2609684467315674	One day , the company of the society called me and asked me if I wanted to take a talk about a conference on the sustainable aspect of his partner .
H-902	-0.9435220956802368	&quot; Absolutely , &quot; I said .
H-903	-1.0058670043945312	We had a company that was trying to solve what became a global problem for our leaders :
H-904	-1.5420421361923218	How do you keep the fish on our menus ?
H-905	-1.2672518491744995	In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been focused in the seas as we have the forests .
H-906	-1.0794209241867065	It &apos;s hard to treat the destruction .
H-907	-1.6224019527435303	90 percent of the big fish , the ones that we like , the tunas , the edges , the salmon , the dishes , have seen their stores come up .
H-908	-0.855602502822876	There &apos;s almost more nothing .
H-909	-1.0061190128326416	So , for the best or for the worst , the recycling , the fish of fish , will be part of our future .
H-910	-0.908836305141449	There &apos;s a lot of arguments against this practice .
H-911	-1.9271665811538696	And the farms of a highly peaceful , at least most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , take a example of the tuna .
H-912	-1.4745707511901855	A big failure .
H-913	-1.8218551874160767	He has a million @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@
H-914	-1.9311012029647827	It means that it &apos;s going to be a couple of fish fish to get a drop of tuna tuna .
H-915	-0.7432782053947449	Not very sustainable .
H-916	-1.460106372833252	Not very good taste .
H-917	-1.0103158950805664	So this is , finally , a company that tries to do doing things .
H-918	-0.43548887968063354	I wanted to support them .
H-919	-0.8604737520217896	The day of the event , I called the director of the public relationships of the company .
H-920	-1.2601869106292725	Let &apos;s call it .
H-921	-1.2540957927703857	&quot; Don &apos;t say , &quot; Just I said , &quot; Just to understand your fish , you &apos;re down to raise your fish if far in the sea , that you don &apos;t . &quot;
H-922	-1.113923192024231	&quot; That &apos;s true &quot; said , &quot; We &apos;re installed so far , that the waste of our fish are embedded , not focused . &quot;
H-923	-0.782344400882721	And then he added , &quot; We &apos;re fundamentally a autonomous world .
H-924	-1.9807484149932861	The U.S. ratio ? A one to one , &quot; did he said ,
H-925	-0.5732759833335876	&quot; The best in the business . &quot;
H-926	-1.5645146369934082	A one for one , not bad --
H-927	-1.8090393543243408	&quot; Do for one what ? You put them with what ? &quot;
H-928	-1.7258461713790894	&quot; sustainable proteins . &quot; A &quot; he said .
H-929	-0.9837671518325806	&quot; Great , &quot; I said . I &apos;ve got the phone .
H-930	-0.5998106002807617	And this night , I was in my bed , and I thought , &quot; But what do it can be , a sustainable protein ? &quot;
H-931	-0.9140374660491943	So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
H-932	-0.7673825621604919	I said , &quot; Don &apos;t can give me a few examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
H-933	-0.9093512892723083	He said he didn &apos;t know . He would have to ask it around him .
H-934	-0.7931786179542542	So , I had a couple of people in the phone .
H-935	-0.7393035888671875	Nobody could give me a clear response .
H-936	-1.6193609237670898	Until finally , I had the phone the biologist in the head .
H-937	-1.4916412830352783	Let &apos;s take it .
H-938	-0.8732725977897644	&quot; Don &apos;t say , &quot; can you give me a few examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
H-939	-0.8519054055213928	Well , he mentioned some algae and some of the fish , and then he said , &quot; &quot; chicken . &quot;
H-940	-1.2575992345809937	I said , &quot; Are chicken ? &quot;
H-941	-1.4664134979248047	He said , &quot; Yeah , the feathers , the skin , the bones of bone , the remains , green and transformed into animals . &quot;
H-942	-0.48141786456108093	I said , &quot; What is the percentage of chicken in food ? &quot;
H-943	-0.7027027010917664	I thought , you see , something like two percent .
H-944	-0.6147390604019165	&quot; Well , about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
H-945	-0.7224907875061035	I asked him , &quot; Don &apos;t be sustainable to feed fish with chicken ? &quot;
H-946	-0.7700698375701904	There was a long silence in line , and he said , &quot; It &apos;s just that there &apos;s too much chickens in the world . &quot;
H-947	-0.9458596706390381	My love for this fish is extinct .
H-948	-1.661163568496704	No , it &apos;s not because I &apos;m a robotic kitchen and well .
H-949	-0.7252693772315979	What I am , in fact .
H-950	-0.7700977921485901	No , my love for this fish happened because , I swear it in God , after this conversation , the fish had a chicken taste .
H-951	-0.8045386075973511	The second fish , it &apos;s another kind of love story .
H-952	-0.9528037309646606	It &apos;s the kind of romantic , the kind of things you learn to know your fish , more you like fish .
H-953	-0.8326802849769592	I &apos;ve first eaten in a restaurant in the south of Spain .
H-954	-1.0587656497955322	A friend journalist told me about this fish for a long time .
H-955	-2.2180352210998535	It &apos;s kind of a lot of it .
H-956	-1.5529556274414062	He happened on the table with a white white color , almost .
H-957	-1.7791627645492554	The chief was too successful .
H-958	-0.5369032025337219	Something like two times too long .
H-959	-1.3242764472961426	Well , it was always delicious .
H-960	-1.8447901010513306	Who can do that a fish has good taste after having been too angry ?
H-961	-0.946985125541687	Not me , but this guy happened .
H-962	-1.2640984058380127	Let &apos;s take it .
H-963	-1.758662462234497	In fact he &apos;s called May .
H-964	-1.122240424156189	And not , he didn &apos;t get the fish , and it wasn &apos;t a chef .
H-965	-1.400105595588684	So not at the sense where you and I hear it .
H-966	-2.527498722076416	It &apos;s a biologist of the same side .
H-967	-0.848519504070282	It &apos;s a fish of fish in the south of Spain .
H-968	-1.6743496656417847	It &apos;s at the mouth of the dark river .
H-969	-1.3545265197753906	Until in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands .
H-970	-3.022090196609497	They &apos;ve got some of the car of them on what was essentially from the ground .
H-971	-1.5112046003341675	They made it in the land of the land .
H-972	-1.1458086967468262	They built this complex series of canals , they have the water water and sent it into the river .
H-973	-0.9176367521286011	Finally , it didn &apos;t work , economically .
H-974	-1.3234491348266602	And it was a disaster .
H-975	-0.7162068486213684	It killed about 90 percent of the birds , which , for the place , represents a lot of birds .
H-976	-1.4375474452972412	And in 1982 , a private company with a environmental consciousness that makes the ground .
H-977	-0.4761660397052765	What did they do ?
H-978	-1.7048437595367432	They put the water of the water .
H-979	-1.584294319152832	They literally got the switch .
H-980	-1.1143813133239746	Instead of extract water , they used the canals to bring water .
H-981	-1.919286847114563	They &apos;ve got the channels .
H-982	-2.211634874343872	They created a small @-@ foot @-@ old @-@ foot farm , you know , shrimp , shrimp and in this process , and this company have completely hit the ecological destruction .
H-983	-1.2251091003417969	The farm is amazing .
H-984	-0.8477548360824585	I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything .
H-985	-1.1113826036453247	You ask the eyes on a horizon that is on millions of miles , and everything you see , these are white channels and this thick and rich land land .
H-986	-1.4789026975631714	I was there , there &apos;s a little time with this .
H-987	-1.7847301959991455	It &apos;s a incredible guy , three quarters of Charles Darwin and a quarter of the brain .
H-988	-1.6664851903915405	OK ? Now , we &apos;re walking to work in the remote areas , and I &apos;m focused and drinking , mud up to the lap , and it gives a lesson of biology .
H-989	-1.6050447225570679	It shows a very white puzzle .
H-990	-2.009495973587036	And then , he &apos;s talking about the needs in the minerals .
H-991	-1.2554938793182373	And here , here , he sees a model model that reminds him the Tanzania of Tanzania .
H-992	-0.820472776889801	It turns out that it spent the largest part of his career in the National National Park in Africa .
H-993	-0.8752339482307434	I asked him how he became a expert in fish .
H-994	-0.7870959639549255	He said , &quot; In fish ? I didn &apos;t know about fish .
H-995	-0.8599056601524353	I &apos;m expert in relationships . &quot;
H-996	-1.0088430643081665	And then , he would go into his conversation about rare birds and algae and strange plants .
H-997	-1.1539047956466675	And you don &apos;t get you , it was really fascinating , you know , something like &quot; The community in live . &quot;
H-998	-0.4618467688560486	It was great , but I was in love .
H-999	-1.5186265707015991	And I &apos;m still going to remember that this piece too a lot of fish fish that I had the last night .
H-1000	-1.18769371509552	So I interrupted it . I said , &quot; Well , what is it so good taste to your fish ?
H-1001	-1.047799825668335	He showed me the algae .
H-1002	-1.1377487182617188	&quot; I know , guy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it &apos;s great --
H-1003	-0.672154426574707	But what do eat your fish ?
H-1004	-2.20292329788208	What &apos;s the operating @-@ food ratio ?
H-1005	-1.0236161947250366	Now , it continues to explain me is a very rich system , that fish eat what they eat in nature .
H-1006	-1.8465732336044312	The biomass of plants , , , you know , you know , that &apos;s the fish .
H-1007	-1.3468583822250366	The system is so healthy , that it would self up completely totally .
H-1008	-1.0441257953643799	We don &apos;t get them .
H-1009	-1.0758792161941528	Have you heard about a farm that doesn &apos;t feed his animals ?
H-1010	-1.1985985040664673	And over this day , I was doing a turn on property property with this , and I asked him , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike all the local farms that I &apos;ve ever seen , how do you measure it ? &quot;
H-1011	-1.6946852207183838	At this moment , it was like a scene in stage had suddenly changed the point .
H-1012	-1.5032607316970825	We took a point , and there has seen a absolutely amazing show , thousands and thousands of pink , a real pink carpet , if it &apos;s also far as the view .
H-1013	-0.9313411712646484	&quot; That &apos;s the success , &quot; he said .
H-1014	-1.9279377460479736	&quot; Look at their spheres , all that &#93; pink .
H-1015	-1.9904932975769043	They &apos;re in it .
H-1016	-1.428056001663208	In the way ? I was completely lost .
H-1017	-1.0657893419265747	I said , &quot; Well , is they going to get up with your fish ? &quot;
H-1018	-0.6807743906974792	&quot; Yes , &quot; he said ,
H-1019	-0.7088479995727539	&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and eggs of fish because of birds .
H-1020	-0.6020026803016663	Well , last year , on this property there were 600 birds , more than 250 different species .
H-1021	-1.4039747714996338	It &apos;s become , today , the biggest and one of the most important of birds in the Western birds . &quot;
H-1022	-1.2984973192214966	I said , &quot; Well , a population of birds in a lot , is not the last thing we want on a fish of fish ? &quot;
H-1023	-1.2950149774551392	He would get the head , &quot; No . &quot;
H-1024	-2.5348947048187256	He said , &quot; We &apos;ve got a low @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ ,
H-1025	-1.1504454612731934	It &apos;s a ecological network .
H-1026	-1.6465940475463867	They eat the shrimp .
H-1027	-1.8368998765945435	The shrimp will eat it .
H-1028	-1.2865819931030273	So , more the belly is pink , better is going on the system . &quot;
H-1029	-0.8823847770690918	OK , now .
H-1030	-0.9579209685325623	A farm that doesn &apos;t feed his animals , is a farm that measure his success to the health of its predators .
H-1031	-1.4285552501678467	One farm farm , but also a birds of birds .
H-1032	-1.0933723449707031	Oh , and in the way , these things , first , they don &apos;t even be there .
H-1033	-1.1706665754318237	They &apos;re in a city to 250 miles from there , where the soil is more to build their nests .
H-1034	-0.7951194643974304	Every morning , they fly on 250 miles to get the farm .
H-1035	-1.021765112876892	And every night , they get 250 miles for the back .
H-1036	-1.0367381572723389	They do this because they &apos;re going to follow the white line of the highway highway .
H-1037	-2.161843776702881	Without a joke .
H-1038	-1.4007575511932373	I had a thing in the kind of the work of penguins , then I looked at it .
H-1039	-0.8164795637130737	I said , &quot; Wow , they really make 250 miles to come to the farm , and the night , they get 250 miles in the other sense ?
H-1040	-0.8986493945121765	Is they doing that for little ? &quot;
H-1041	-1.7612404823303223	He looked at me as if I had to quote a song of the Whitney Whitney .
H-1042	-0.29157787561416626	He said , &quot; No , they do it because food is better . &quot;
H-1043	-0.9702427983283997	I didn &apos;t talked about the skin of my fish , which was delicious , and I don &apos;t like the fish of fish .
H-1044	-0.8161540031433105	I don &apos;t like it . I don &apos;t like it .
H-1045	-1.8946391344070435	It &apos;s so scary , it &apos;s the flavor of the tar .
H-1046	-1.843352198600769	I don &apos;t get it to be in cooking .
H-1047	-1.230812668800354	Yet , when I put it in this restaurant in the Spain of Spain , she didn &apos;t have the taste of the fish of fish .
H-1048	-1.6852364540100098	She had a soft taste and own as if you &apos;re going to make a ocean of the ocean .
H-1049	-2.2171919345855713	And I said that to be there , and he &apos;s going to do .
H-1050	-0.538895308971405	He said , &quot; The skin is like a sponge .
H-1051	-1.2252713441848755	It &apos;s the last side of defense before something doesn &apos;t get in the organism .
H-1052	-1.722947597503662	She has evolved to absorb the tropics . &quot;
H-1053	-1.134827733039856	And then he added it , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t know . &quot;
H-1054	-1.1245067119598389	OK . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed his fish .
H-1055	-0.8884085416793823	A farm that measure his success by the success of his predators .
H-1056	-1.6395142078399658	And then I realized that when he said , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have to turn , &quot; it was a strong , because the water that goes into this exploitation comes from the river .
H-1057	-1.1922322511672974	It &apos;s the river that takes with it all the things that the rivers tend to wear our days , chemical chemicals , from pesticides .
H-1058	-1.2378777265548706	And when she makes its way through the system and then , the water is more own than when it &apos;s in the entrance .
H-1059	-1.2101290225982666	The system is so healthy that it gets the water .
H-1060	-0.8711066246032715	So not only a farm that doesn &apos;t get its animals , not just a farm that measure his success to the health health , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water factory , and not just for these fish , but for you and I also .
H-1061	-1.0237071514129639	Because when the water turns out , it turns out in the Atlantic .
H-1062	-0.8522380590438843	A drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;m going to take it , and you should do the same , because this story of love , even if it &apos;s romantic , is also a lot .
H-1063	-1.3715664148330688	You might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of the good food , that you &apos;re talking about bars , or just just show .
H-1064	-1.0762016773223877	What we need now is a new new design design , which food has really good taste .
H-1065	-1.1414132118225098	But for a lot of people is a bit too dramatic .
H-1066	-2.0190725326538086	We &apos;re not going to do , we &apos;re others .
H-1067	-1.9283462762832642	We &apos;re amateurs .
H-1068	-1.0681312084197998	We love the markets of producers .
H-1069	-2.055634021759033	We like the little ones .
H-1070	-0.6521823406219482	We &apos;re talking about local food .
H-1071	-1.9303736686706543	We eat organic .
H-1072	-0.9689433574676514	And when you suggest that it &apos;s all that will make the future of the good food , someone , somewhere , and says , &quot; Hey , I love the pink , but how do you go to feed the world ?
H-1073	-0.7299998998641968	How are you going to make the world ? &quot;
H-1074	-0.8827424645423889	Can I be honest ?
H-1075	-0.4910197854042053	I don &apos;t like this question .
H-1076	-0.6524929404258728	No , it &apos;s not because we &apos;re already more than enough calories to feed the world .
H-1077	-0.6991189122200012	A billion people will be hungry today .
H-1078	-1.423371434211731	A billion -- more than never before -- because of the dark inequality in the distribution , and not the judge .
H-1079	-0.7800694108009338	I don &apos;t like this question because she determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years .

H-1081	-1.342689037322998	This has been our motivation . It was the same . It was the urban plan of American agriculture .
H-1082	-1.6591465473175049	You need to look at the things in front . It &apos;s a field of activity in a field of the background , a activity that will quickly the ecological capital that makes its own possible production .
H-1083	-0.832548975944519	It &apos;s not a company , nor agriculture .

H-1086	-0.4049457311630249	You want to feed the world ?
H-1087	-0.6667394638061523	Let me ask us : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
H-1088	-1.153581976890564	Or , how can we create the conditions that allow us to feed it to feed itself ?
H-1089	-1.2429779767990112	To do it , don &apos;t take the model of the way for your future .
H-1090	-1.0906221866607666	It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s .
H-1091	-0.9780585169792175	It costs to capital , chemistry and machines , and there &apos;s never nothing really good to eat .
H-1092	-1.6961159706115723	In the contrary , let &apos;s take the ecological model .
H-1093	-1.2636774778366089	This is the one that is based on two billion years of experience on the whole lot .
H-1094	-2.2321484088897705	Look at them , the farmers as they have .
H-1095	-2.13999080657959	And in the local States that are not going to be in themselves , farms that are going to the place , farms that work in the way , the farms that are working in , and not just experts , but also experts in relationships ,
H-1096	-1.184226393699646	because it &apos;s also those who are experts to taste .
H-1097	-1.0194275379180908	And , to be totally honest , they do a better leader I &apos;m never going to be it .
H-1098	-0.6952534317970276	You know , it doesn &apos;t want me , because if it &apos;s that , the future of the good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
H-1099	-0.7526448965072632	Thank you . I grew up with science science .
H-1100	-0.8242943286895752	In high school , I was taking the bus to go to school , every day , a hour hour in every sense .
H-1101	-1.6340348720550537	And I was always stuck in a book , a science of science , which is taking my mind to other worlds , and he was , in his form form , my own curiosity of then .
H-1102	-1.5242044925689697	And this curiosity is also a time that every time I wasn &apos;t in school , I &apos;ll go into the wood , to walk and pick up &quot; samples , &quot; frogs , snakes , insects and water and water coming out of the air , that I would get to look at the microscope .
H-1103	-0.6801787614822388	You know , I was a real bit of science .
H-1104	-0.5670182704925537	But it was to try to understand the world , understand the limits of possible .
H-1105	-1.2202526330947876	And my love of science science seemed to be able to be in the world that was going on , because of all what was going on , we was at the end of the &apos; 60s , we were going to be on the moon , we &apos;re going to be the ocean of the oceans .
H-1106	-1.3661631345748901	Jacques Cousteau came in our living in our incredible emissions that showed us out of animals and places , and a wonderful world , that we would never have been really imagine before .
H-1107	-1.117621660232544	So , we would say that it &apos;s going to do with all the science @-@ fiction side of the time .
H-1108	-0.20789922773838043	And I was a artist .
H-1109	-0.34228459000587463	I could draw . I could paint .
H-1110	-0.7870002388954163	And I realized that , because there was no video video and this movies of movies in images , and all this imaging in the media landscape , then I had to create these images in my head .
H-1111	-0.8605235815048218	You know , as we all did , like kids who read a book and , through the description of the author , which goes out something on the screen in their head .
H-1112	-1.560598373413086	Well , my answer to that , it was paint , to draw the creatures , the organic worlds , robots , robots , all these stuff .
H-1113	-1.76400625705719	In math , I was going to do all the time in the world behind my class book .
H-1114	-1.3605912923812866	It was -- it was the creativity that had to find his own , sort of .
H-1115	-1.4254753589630127	And then a interesting thing happened , a sign of Jacques Cousteau really was really excited in me to understand that it was a alien world , here on Earth .
H-1116	-1.3592588901519775	There was a little chance that I can really go to a day on a foreign planet in the spaceship .
H-1117	-1.438464879989624	It seemed to be more likely .
H-1118	-0.8813837170600891	But there was a world where I could really go , here , on Earth , and that was also rich and exotic that everything I had to imagine in reading these books .
H-1119	-0.9338197708129883	So , I decided to become a submarine under the age of 15 years .
H-1120	-1.16947603225708	And the only problem was that I was living in a little village in Canada , about one miles of the ocean the most close .
H-1121	-0.92739337682724	But I &apos;m not left me .
H-1122	-1.1213152408599854	I &apos;ve been doing my father until it turns out of diving , New York , just from the other side of the border .
H-1123	-1.1189624071121216	And in fact , I spent my degree in the pool of a room , in the winter of winter , in Buffalo , New York .
H-1124	-0.9345263838768005	And I haven &apos;t seen the ocean , a real ocean , for the last two years , until we &apos;re doing in California .
H-1125	-0.940662682056427	Since in the last 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours under the water , which 500 hours on the ocean .
H-1126	-0.7448150515556335	And I learned a thing is that this middle of the deep ocean , and even the most profound oceans , are so rich of a amazing life that is really beyond our imagination .
H-1127	-1.1255007982254028	The imagination of nature is without limits to our own human human imagination .
H-1128	-1.751729130744934	Again today , I &apos;m a lot of total of what I see when I do these dives .
H-1129	-1.0036722421646118	And my story of love with the ocean still still , and also as strong that she ever been .
H-1130	-0.910706102848053	But when , adult , I chose a job , it was the movies of films .
H-1131	-0.8687828183174133	And it seemed to be the best way that I had to tell stories , with my want to make images .
H-1132	-1.793906331062317	And when I was a kid , I was going to go out of the old books , things like this .
H-1133	-0.8993869423866272	So , the movie was the way to put together pictures and stories . And that had sense .
H-1134	-0.8924140930175781	And of course , the stories I chose to tell stories about science stories : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H-1135	-1.6451411247253418	And with &quot; Stop , &quot; I &apos;ve got to even time my love from the world under the submarine and diving , with the film of film .
H-1136	-1.7257399559020996	I have to say , let &apos;s take the two passions .
H-1137	-1.0606077909469604	Something , something interesting , which was that to solve a specific problem of storytelling in this film , which was to create a kind of liquid creature , made from water , we &apos;ve actually chosen the animation generated by computer , the image of synthesis .
H-1138	-0.9279659986495972	And that gave the first electronic character in a image that we &apos;ve ever seen in a film .
H-1139	-1.1807197332382202	And even if the movie has no money , we &apos;ve got to have the balance , I would say , I saw something incredible : the audience , the audience of the world &apos;s public .
H-1140	-1.6367045640945435	You know , it &apos;s the Law of Arthur Arthur who says that all any enough technology is a lot of magic .
H-1141	-1.7253270149230957	People are about something magic .
H-1142	-1.3600983619689941	And that was a lot of me .
H-1143	-0.6490959525108337	And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something that has to be adopted by the art art . &quot;
H-1144	-1.148447036743164	So , with &quot; &quot; Two 2 , &quot; which was my next movie , we &apos;ve got this much further .
H-1145	-1.063784122467041	In working with it , we created the guy in metal liquid . The success was in fact that this effect works or not .
H-1146	-0.5298117399215698	And it worked . And again we created the magic .
H-1147	-0.658168613910675	And we had the same result with the audience .
H-1148	-0.7924901247024536	Even if we did a little bit more money on this .
H-1149	-1.139709711074829	So , in fact , one of these two points of experience , what we was in , that it was going to be a new world , it was a new world of creativity for the artists of the movies .
H-1150	-1.8960514068603516	So , I &apos;ve got a company with 29 centimeters , my friend friend , I was the best designer of Kyoto and creatures at the time , and we called it , &quot; We call it . &quot;
H-1151	-1.7583390474319458	And the concept of the society was to do directly on it by top of the analog @-@ based processes , and to go directly to the digital production .
H-1152	-1.0642566680908203	What we did and who gave us a advantage for a certain time .
H-1153	-0.9520291090011597	But we took up in the middle of the 1990s in the design of characters and creatures that we had created this society .
H-1154	-1.330747365951538	So , I wrote this scenario that I called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which had to be going to push out the borders of the visual effects , digital effects , with human characters , able to emotions , you know , in a image of synthesis . And the main characters would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image . And the world would be in a image of synthesis . And the world would be in a image . And
H-1155	-0.8657854795455933	And there , the guy of my society told me that we were not going to be able to do that before a good moment .
H-1156	-1.0606623888015747	So , I put it on the side , and I did this other film on a big ship that goes .
H-1157	-0.9561405181884766	You know , I went to summarize that at the studio like &quot; Romeo and Juliet on a boat . &quot;
H-1158	-1.094312310218811	It was going to be a movie and romantic film , a passionate movie .
H-1159	-1.1581029891967773	In secret , what I wanted to do , it was diving on the real world of the Titanic . &quot;
H-1160	-0.5939191579818726	And that &apos;s why I did the film .
H-1161	-0.4345209002494812	And that &apos;s the truth . Okay , the studio didn &apos;t know .
H-1162	-1.0896519422531128	But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive on the corner . We &apos;re going to get the film for real .
H-1163	-1.4962247610092163	We have it for the opening of the film .
H-1164	-1.1102023124694824	It &apos;s really important . It &apos;s going to be a great fan of marketing . &quot;
H-1165	-1.14962637424469	And I told them to fund a expedition .
H-1166	-0.6701166033744812	It seems crazy . But you go back to this idea of your imagination that creates a reality .
H-1167	-1.2964627742767334	Because we actually created a reality where six months later , I &apos;ve been looking at a hot submersible , at four miles of depth in the North Atlantic , to look at the real world through a window , not a film , not a movie , but for true .
H-1168	-1.4875255823135376	I was in the state of shock .
H-1169	-0.5123369693756104	He took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
H-1170	-1.2721844911575317	But , it struck me how to do this dive , these deep dives , looked at a space mission .
H-1171	-0.9710600972175598	You know , it &apos;s a very technical side , which requires a lot of planning .
H-1172	-1.0445740222930908	You go into this capsule , you go down in this dark and hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope if you don &apos;t get to get you out of you .
H-1173	-0.7738140225410461	And I thought , &quot; Wow . This is as if I lived in a science of science .
H-1174	-0.4472688138484955	It &apos;s really cool . &quot;
H-1175	-1.4805965423583984	And yes , I &apos;ve really been looking at the virus of the exploration exploration .
H-1176	-0.7638837099075317	Obviously , even curiosity , and the scientific side .
H-1177	-0.714730978012085	It was all that . It was the adventure , it was curiosity . It was the imagination .
H-1178	-0.6499362587928772	And this was a experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
H-1179	-0.43937498331069946	Because , you know , I could imagine a creature , and we could create a visual effect for her . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I saw by this window .
H-1180	-1.3607178926467896	And in some of our expeditions , I &apos;ve seen creatures to look at the remote chimneys and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had never seen before , which had never been done by science at the moment we &apos;ve seen and find .
H-1181	-1.4310029745101929	So , I really came up a crazy bit of all that , and he took me more .
H-1182	-0.7314153909683228	And so , I took a pretty curious decision .
H-1183	-0.9965510368347168	After the success of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to put my job of movies to Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to get a lot of time for a moment . &quot;
H-1184	-1.4912410974502563	And we started the planning of these expeditions .
H-1185	-1.5507423877716064	And we &apos;ve been found to go back to it , and explore it with robotic vehicles .
H-1186	-1.011655569076538	We went back to the Gulf of the Titanic .
H-1187	-1.3093554973602295	We took the little robots that we had created , those who &apos;s going to be a optical fiber .
H-1188	-0.7128567695617676	The idea was to go in , and do a study of the inside of this ship , which had never been done .
H-1189	-0.9883161783218384	No one had never looked at the inside of it . They didn &apos;t have the ways to do it , but we created technology to do it .
H-1190	-0.9910191297531128	So , here , I &apos;m now , there , on the bridge of the Titanic , sitting in a submersible , looking at the way that look like a lot of these , where I knew the orchestra had played .
H-1191	-1.484731912612915	And I went to a little little vehicle vehicle that through the ship of the ship .
H-1192	-0.5192179679870605	In fact , I control it to distance , but my mind is in the vehicle .
H-1193	-1.0636615753173828	I felt like if I was physically now inside the Titanic of the Titanic .
H-1194	-1.181510329246521	And that was the biggest experience of already seen that I &apos;ve ever lived , because before we take a point , I knew already what there was going to be there , before the lights of the vehicle , because I had the stage stage for months when we were doing the film .
H-1195	-1.4534426927566528	And the stage was built as a very based thing on the ship of the ship .
H-1196	-0.5842489004135132	Yes , it was a absolutely remarkable experience .
H-1197	-1.2067068815231323	And it really made me to understand a thing , the experience of the way , that you can really experience with these robotic avatars , that your consciousness is down in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
H-1198	-0.8870869278907776	It was really really , very profound .
H-1199	-1.0580065250396729	And maybe a little glimpse of what can happen in a few decades when we &apos;re starting to have the body for exploration or in other goals in many post @-@ human future , as I can imagine , as a fiction of science .
H-1200	-0.9643440246582031	So , after having these expeditions , and really began to appreciate what there was there , in the bottom , like these chimneys in the ocean of the ocean , where we had these animals .
H-1201	-0.9732933044433594	These are strangers in the real sense of the term , here , on Earth .
H-1202	-1.2091634273529053	They live in a food environment .
H-1203	-0.7849897146224976	They don &apos;t survive in a system based on the sunlight of the Sun , as we do it .
H-1204	-1.0413568019866943	And then you can see animals that live on the hot water , more than 500 degrees C .
H-1205	-1.204000473022461	We don &apos;t know that they can exist .
H-1206	-0.7944824695587158	In the same time I started to be very interested in space science , again , the influence of science science , as when I was a kid .
H-1207	-1.7337825298309326	And I ended up to be involved in the space community , really involved with NASA , to get to NASA &apos;s advice of NASA , to plan in the space , to go to Russia , follow in Russia , and all of these kinds of things , in the purpose of making me for the international space in our 3D cameras in our 3D cameras .
H-1208	-0.3590291440486908	And it was fascinating .
H-1209	-1.0650538206100464	But what I ended up to do is to bring the scientists of space with us in the depths .
H-1210	-1.163832426071167	And to take them to the bottom , that they have access , which , scientists , scientists are interested in these extreme environments , down them down to the chimneys , and let them see , take samples , take their instruments of test , and so on .
H-1211	-1.7861969470977783	Now , here , we &apos;re going to make the movies , but actually we did science , and even the space science .
H-1212	-0.8915139436721802	I had completely shared the loop between science @-@ fiction , you know , the kid , and do this kind of things for real .
H-1213	-1.1030492782592773	And you know , all at the way of this discovery of discovery , I have a lot of learned .
H-1214	-0.7716218829154968	I &apos;ve got a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership .
H-1215	-0.8561762571334839	You tell you that a scene in stage has to be a leader , a leader , a captain of the ship , and all this kind of thing .
H-1216	-1.1568429470062256	I didn &apos;t really know great thing about leadership until I did these expeditions .
H-1217	-0.7143416404724121	Because I had to , at a certain point , to say , &quot; What do I do here ?
H-1218	-0.8107001781463623	Why am I doing it ? What do I have to take it ? &quot;
H-1219	-1.4956620931625366	We don &apos;t do money with these emissions .
H-1220	-2.1943304538726807	It &apos;s just going to do it . It &apos;s not going to do .
H-1221	-1.230469822883606	People had to think that I was gone , between the Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and that I had to be able to go out of them somewhere , sitting on a beach .
H-1222	-1.6470119953155518	You &apos;ve done all these movies , these films , and they have a very limited audience .
H-1223	-1.7284656763076782	No glory , no more , no money . But what &apos;s you going to happen ?
H-1224	-0.810656726360321	We did it for the thing itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the environment with the most challenges that is -- for the pleasure of discovery , and for this strange connection that creates when a little group of people form a very aggressive team .
H-1225	-0.8675042390823364	Because these are things that we do with 10 @-@ 12 people in working together for years .
H-1226	-1.3396811485290527	Sometimes , on the sea for two @-@ three months .
H-1227	-0.6859771013259888	And in this link , you realize that the most important thing is the respect you have to themselves and they have to you , that you have a task that you can &apos;t explain someone else .
H-1229	-0.6181261539459229	It creates a link , it creates a respect of respect .
H-1230	-0.8652102947235107	So , when I went back to do my movie film , which was &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to apply this same principle of leadership that is that you have your team , and you win their respect in return .
H-1231	-0.5652022957801819	And it really changed the dynamic .
H-1232	-1.1740026473999023	So , I looked at again with a little team , the unknown territory , which is &quot; Avatar , &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
H-1233	-1.7526509761810303	It &apos;s exciting .
H-1234	-1.9667177200317383	It &apos;s going to hard .
H-1235	-0.8687618374824524	And we became a family , on a four @-@ year period and a half .
H-1236	-0.6271527409553528	And it completely changed the way I do movies .
H-1237	-1.1928033828735352	So people made observations on the way that I had brought the ocean organisms to put them on the planet .
H-1238	-0.9492168426513672	For me , it was more of how to do business , the process itself , which has changed on this .
H-1239	-1.7168947458267212	So , what does we get to do this ?
H-1240	-0.6451233625411987	You know , what are the lessons that we learned ?
H-1241	-1.0866423845291138	Well , I think the number of one is : curiosity .
H-1242	-1.0283443927764893	It &apos;s the most powerful thing that you &apos;re doing .
H-1243	-0.8723365068435669	The imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
H-1244	-0.5738316178321838	And the respect of your team is more important than everybody in the world .
H-1245	-1.0997880697250366	There are young guys who come to me , &quot; Give me advice to do this . &quot;
H-1246	-0.9538456201553345	And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t put you the limits .
H-1247	-1.1088242530822754	Other will do it for you , don &apos;t do it for you , don &apos;t play against you .
H-1248	-1.1630560159683228	And take risks . &quot;
H-1249	-0.9460750818252563	In NASA , they have this sentence that they do , &quot; The failure is not a option . &quot;
H-1250	-0.465361088514328	But failure has to be a option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a act of faith .
H-1251	-1.8010636568069458	And none of the important effort that we &apos;ve been able to have a risks .
H-1252	-0.8432568311691284	You have to be able to take these risks .
H-1254	-1.5252455472946167	So what we &apos;ve got here is a painting of child mortality in age .
H-1255	-0.6025618314743042	The tool I use here is a little experiment .
H-1256	-1.1242649555206299	It &apos;s called it , and with the way I can choose to focus on a cause of deaths in particular , let &apos;s say accidents .
H-1257	-1.0451182126998901	And , immediately , I see a different trend that &apos;s going to be .
H-1258	-0.7012786269187927	It &apos;s because , in the middle of the middle , people are the most active , and here they are the most fragile .
H-1259	-1.707921028137207	You can come out to the new , and the data of the causes of deaths , you see that the heart disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
H-1260	-1.1282261610031128	If you continue and filter by age , let &apos;s say 40 or less , you see that accidents are actually the biggest cause that people should worry about .
H-1261	-1.0386465787887573	And if you &apos;re still a little bit , it &apos;s particularly true for men .
H-1262	-1.049837589263916	Anyway , you understand the idea that see information , see the data of this way , looks like a lot to swim in a living of data of data .
H-1263	-1.0655051469802856	And if we can do this with the raw data , why don &apos;t we do it with content as well ?
H-1264	-1.4679807424545288	So what we &apos;ve been here is the cover of every number of the world will ever come out .
H-1265	-1.0846973657608032	It &apos;s there . It &apos;s online .
H-1266	-1.1168469190597534	You can go back and try and try to my presentation .
H-1267	-1.095822811126709	With the way , you can zoom on a decade .
H-1268	-0.6242690682411194	You can zoom on a particular year .
H-1269	-0.7530189156532288	You can make you directly on a specific number .
H-1270	-1.0216492414474487	So I look at this ; I see the athletes who went into this number , the sports .
H-1271	-1.7712219953536987	I &apos;m a fan of Armstrong Armstrong , so I &apos;m going to click up there , which I &apos;ve been showing all the numbers in which I &apos;m born .
H-1272	-1.0424082279205322	Now , if I just want to take a look at the eye , I could say , &quot; Well , and if we look at all what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
H-1273	-0.6912665963172913	So I can take a little bit of it , and explore this idea .
H-1274	-1.6780085563659668	And I see Greg now now .
H-1275	-1.4148472547531128	And you start to understand the idea that when you get in the information of this way , in the way , you &apos;re going to get you , you don &apos;t look at , you don &apos;t get it .
H-1276	-0.6206063628196716	You do something that is actually a little different .
H-1277	-0.6412806510925293	It &apos;s between two , and we think this changes the way that information can be used .
H-1278	-0.9278421998023987	And I &apos;d like to see on this idea a little bit with something that is slightly crazy .
H-1279	-1.0619895458221436	What we &apos;ve done here is that we took every page of Wikipedia and put them to a small summary .
H-1280	-1.3232941627502441	So the summary is just made out of small , and a icon for the theme that it comes out .
H-1281	-1.2535678148269653	I &apos;m not showing here that the last 500 pages of Wikipedia .
H-1282	-0.7503896951675415	But even in this limited view , you can do a bunch of things .
H-1283	-1.3259763717651367	Immediately , we have a idea of the lower areas that are most popular on Wikipedia .
H-1284	-1.35679030418396	I &apos;m going to go up and choose the government .
H-1285	-1.8409820795059204	Now , with the government , I can now see that the categories of Wikipedia that are able to see the most popular of this are the way of the Year of the Time magazine .
H-1286	-1.341957688331604	And it &apos;s important because it &apos;s a way that wasn &apos;t in any of the pages of Wikipedia .
H-1287	-1.2930127382278442	It &apos;s possible to do this observation that by taking the back and watching them all .
H-1288	-1.5947285890579224	In looking at the one of these particular summaries , I can now dig the concept of the magazine of the magazine of the Time magazine , in it all all .
H-1289	-0.8521633744239807	In looking at these people , I see that the majority of the government .
H-1290	-1.0372607707977295	Some of the natural sciences .
H-1291	-1.145190954208374	Other , less many again , come from the business world .
H-1292	-1.0785783529281616	This is my boss .
H-1293	-0.9827291369438171	And one comes from the world of music .
H-1294	-1.5807089805603027	And in fact , Bono is also a TED Prize .
H-1295	-1.3383492231369019	So you can continue , move , and take a eye to all the Nobel Prize .
H-1296	-0.876548171043396	And you see , we &apos;re running the network for the first time as if it was actually a network , not page in page , but to a smaller degree of abstraction .
H-1297	-0.9747120141983032	And also I &apos;d like to show you another thing that could do you take a little bit of surprise .
H-1298	-0.6490569114685059	I &apos;m just showing you the website of New York Times here .
H-1299	-0.8396586775779724	So , you know , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can visit web pages with -- and we &apos;re looking at this technology technology for every web page like this .
H-1300	-1.0164977312088013	So I can go out , go back to a particular section .
H-1301	-0.8853752613067627	And the reason that it &apos;s important is that , being able to make the web pages of this way I can look at the history of my navigation exactly in the same way .
H-1302	-0.9320425987243652	So I can dig into what I did in the course of some time of time .
H-1303	-1.3614706993103027	The way , in fact , it &apos;s the state of all the way I just come to give .
H-1304	-1.4156266450881958	And I can see some of the things that I &apos;ve done more early today .
H-1305	-1.3920788764953613	And , if I want to go out and just look at my history , maybe my research of research .
H-1306	-2.446263313293457	Now , I was doing the new research , doing research to do , here for the informal of light .
H-1307	-1.011344075202942	And from that , I can dive into the web page and just throw them again .
H-1308	-0.94683438539505	It &apos;s a metaphor of multiple times , and every time it makes the most big than the sum of the parts with the data .
H-1309	-1.1930495500564575	And at this moment , in this world , we think the data are this universe .
H-1310	-0.9301843047142029	We &apos;re talking about the problem of information of information .
H-1311	-1.3213801383972168	We &apos;re talking about the data in the data .
H-1312	-1.2364026308059692	And if we could actually go back to the situation and turn the web , kind of that instead of one thing to another , we &apos;re going to go to a whole set of things to another set of things , and that doing to be able to make the trends that without this would be hidden ?
H-1313	-0.9275311231613159	If we can do that , then , rather than being called data , we could actually extract information .
H-1314	-1.1826748847961426	And , rather than only manage information , we can extract knowledge .
H-1315	-1.2724251747131348	And if we have the knowledge , then there may be even the wisdom to get it .
H-1316	-0.9470497965812683	And with that , I thank you . Suppose we have here a machine , a big machine , at TED fashion , a machine machine in the time .
H-1317	-1.425108551979065	Each of us here is going to be there .
H-1318	-0.7215982675552368	You can go back and before , you can &apos;t stay where you &apos;re .
H-1319	-1.24199640750885	I &apos;m asking me what you would say because I asked my friends : they all wanted to go back .
H-1320	-1.0726947784423828	They wanted to go back to the car or Twitter or New Star .
H-1321	-0.23982778191566467	I don &apos;t know .
H-1322	-2.9506983757019043	There &apos;s a kind of an attraction to the rope , to the visual wishes .
H-1323	-0.6979493498802185	I understand that .
H-1324	-0.7252265214920044	I have to say that I &apos;m not part of it .
H-1325	-1.036568522453308	I don &apos;t want to go up by lack of mind , but for the possibilities of this planet . They don &apos;t get , they &apos;re moving .
H-1326	-0.9683621525764465	So I want to go up in this machine and move .
H-1327	-1.196862816810608	It &apos;s the biggest moment that there &apos;s never been on this planet , which is the unit of measure : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , rate .
H-1328	-1.2564700841903687	There &apos;s never had this time .
H-1329	-1.0424375534057617	My great @-@ grandparents are all dead before we had 60 years old .
H-1330	-1.2071030139923096	My great parents came to 70 .
H-1331	-1.4323139190673828	My parents are looking at the 80s .
H-1332	-1.3217484951019287	So I &apos;d like to be good that there &apos;s a nine @-@ early age of my death age .
H-1333	-0.8999140858650208	But it &apos;s not just the people like us because it &apos;s more general than it .
H-1334	-1.0352786779403687	A kid who was in New Delhi today can hope as long as the most rich man in the world 100 years ago .
H-1335	-1.0356711149215698	Think about it . It &apos;s a amazing fact .
H-1336	-0.5896791219711304	Why is this true ?
H-1337	-0.6090318560600281	smallpox : she killed billions of people on this planet .
H-1338	-2.151594877243042	She has been running on the globe as no war has never done .
H-1339	-0.8309163451194763	It &apos;s finished . She disappeared .
H-1340	-1.6224459409713745	We &apos;ve got it up .
H-1341	-1.5232843160629272	In the rich world , the diseases that are developing millions of us there are a generation that has no longer .
H-1342	-2.5120787620544434	This is the way , the root , the polio --
H-1343	-1.8322337865829468	Does anybody know what it is ?
H-1344	-0.7994986772537231	The vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the scientific method .
H-1345	-0.7642002701759338	In my mind , scientific method , try to things , see if they work , change , it &apos;s one of the big advances of humanity .
H-1346	-0.7032577991485596	That &apos;s the good news .
H-1347	-1.1820029020309448	Unfortunately , this are the only good news because there are other problems , there &apos;s a lot of times , and one of them , despite all of our business , is that one billion people are going to get the identical belly in the world , every day .
H-1348	-1.399707317352295	This number increases , very quickly , and it &apos;s clear .
H-1349	-1.3434191942214966	Now , we &apos;ve used our imagination to change this planet .
H-1350	-1.3560725450515747	The drinking water , the earth , the forest forest , the oil , the gas , the gas : they &apos;re moving quickly and at least to get out of this things , we &apos;re going to disappear .
H-1351	-0.5776602029800415	The question is : Can we do it ? I think yes .
H-1352	-1.0413442850112915	It &apos;s clear that we can do food for billions of people without raped the earth that they live .
H-1353	-0.7337123155593872	I think we can produce enough energy without having to destroy the world .
H-1354	-1.0025064945220947	I really believe it . It &apos;s not a storyteller .
H-1355	-1.146254062652588	So this is what I wake up the night , one of the things that makes me to sleep .
H-1356	-0.9782721400260925	We &apos;ve never had a lot of science that now . We &apos;ve never been not more able to use it as we can now today .
H-1357	-1.4067559242248535	We &apos;re in the world of amazing events in many areas .
H-1358	-1.2730809450149536	And yet , I think we have to go to 300 years before the time of the Enlightenment to find a period where we come to the progress , when we get these more strong things and over more than now .
H-1359	-2.1316888332366943	People are going into their beliefs of how they can &apos;t release them .
H-1360	-1.1329994201660156	Even the truth doesn &apos;t count them .
H-1361	-0.8800548911094666	Each is free of his opinions , each one can think what it wants progress , but you know what you can &apos;t do ?
H-1362	-0.9621330499649048	We can &apos;t use the facts . Sorry , we can &apos;t .
H-1363	-0.9114899039268494	It took me time to understand it .
H-1364	-0.631324291229248	10 years ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for the New Yorker .
H-1365	-0.8897836208343506	I was surprised to meet the opposition to what was , after all , the most effective health of the history of human history .
H-1366	-0.6596736311912537	I didn &apos;t know what to do . I just wrote a story and I spent another thing .
H-1367	-1.4834100008010864	And a little bit later , I wrote a story on a genetically engineered food .
H-1368	-0.9644377827644348	Same thing , in worse .
H-1369	-1.598711609840393	People are crazy .
H-1370	-1.3798648118972778	So , I wrote a story on it and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought about the way . &quot; Why does it &apos;s going to move out of the way of the way , it was going to get the laws of nature ?
H-1371	-0.6505337953567505	You know , I do my job : I write the article and this .
H-1372	-1.2346910238265991	I mean , I &apos;m a journalist , you know , you &apos;re crying , we &apos;re going to dinner , it &apos;s good .
H-1373	-1.2172496318817139	But these stories have me . I ended up to understand why .
H-1374	-2.2936789989471436	Well , because these figures that was going to be crazy were not been interested at all .
H-1375	-2.0602450370788574	It was about people , they know , as you have to have .
H-1376	-1.006690263748169	exactly like people in this room .
H-1377	-2.1261465549468994	It has been so much .
H-1378	-1.3345907926559448	And then I thought , let &apos;s be honest : we &apos;re at a point in this world where we &apos;ve got the same report to the progress that before .
H-1379	-1.244084358215332	We &apos;re talking about it .
H-1380	-2.0110881328582764	We &apos;re talking about how it &apos;s looking about , &quot; The intellect . &quot;
H-1381	-0.6513426303863525	There are reasons for that and I think we know .
H-1382	-0.9314013719558716	We lost faith in institutions , in authority and sometimes in the same science . There &apos;s no reasons to not not lost it .
H-1383	-1.325622320175171	It &apos;s just just a few names and people understand .
H-1384	-2.7754809856414795	And then , in the way , well , yes , weapons , weapons of mass destruction , votes .
H-1385	-0.4733237624168396	You can do your list .
H-1386	-1.0287795066833496	There are questions and problems about people that we thought are always right .
H-1387	-1.8739535808563232	Let &apos;s look .
H-1388	-2.1027257442474365	Let &apos;s think about questions , based evidence .
H-1389	-1.0875846147537231	Don &apos;t take anything for money .
H-1390	-0.6393135786056519	But this is the thing : when you have evidence , you have to accept the evidence . We &apos;re not good for that .
H-1391	-1.0551633834838867	The reason is that we &apos;re in a epidemic of fear as I &apos;ve never seen and hope never never .
H-1392	-1.9346716403961182	A 12 years ago has been published a horrible story that led the epidemic of autism to the vaccines , the edges and the direction .
H-1393	-1.868251085281372	Thank you .
H-1394	-1.1615509986877441	Hundreds of studies have been done to see if it was true .

H-1469	-1.8183015584945679	It &apos;s a bit of me if the Minister of health says :

H-1479	-0.7399237155914307	It &apos;s a debate on the words , on metaphors .
H-1480	-0.9238730669021606	It &apos;s the ideology and not science .
H-1481	-1.7164491415023804	All that we eat , every rice of rice , each of them , each of them has been designed by the man .

H-1489	-0.8032081723213196	There are risks . Absolutely .
H-1490	-1.0526835918426514	You can put a kind of vitamin in rice and this thing can help millions of people to test their life .

H-1492	-0.6893465518951416	I have to say that I don &apos;t understand .
H-1493	-2.688112735748291	We &apos;ve got up to the genetically engineered foods .

H-1495	-1.2778961658477783	What I often hear is , too too chemical products , pesticides , hormones , hormones . We don &apos;t want to have a giant range of the same thing . It &apos;s wrong .
H-1496	-1.3532652854919434	We don &apos;t want any societies that are going to be alive .
H-1497	-1.212770700454712	We don &apos;t want to companies that have seeds .
H-1498	-0.8695988655090332	You know my answer to this ?
H-1499	-1.4681921005249023	You &apos;re right . The problem .
H-1500	-0.6398417949676514	It &apos;s true that we have a huge problem of food , but it &apos;s not science .
H-1501	-0.7159469127655029	It doesn &apos;t have to see with science .
H-1502	-1.2744852304458618	It &apos;s the legal , the morality , the intellectual property .
H-1503	-0.4507298469543457	The science is not a company .
H-1504	-0.4039152264595032	It &apos;s not a country .
H-1505	-0.6738119125366211	It &apos;s not not a concept , it &apos;s a process .
H-1506	-1.1421880722045898	Sometimes it works and sometimes not . The idea that we should not leave science work because we fear is really very subtle . It &apos;s taking millions of people .
H-1507	-0.4634169936180115	In the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to produce 70 percent more food than now . 70 percent .
H-1508	-0.8230416178703308	It &apos;s the investment in Africa for 30 years .
H-1509	-1.868251085281372	Thank you .
H-1510	-0.8622560501098633	They need and we don &apos;t give them .
H-1511	-1.78230881690979	Why ?
H-1512	-1.0905317068099976	We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat these things like the way for example .
H-1513	-1.8239519596099854	It &apos;s eaten by a couple of people .
H-1514	-1.4588068723678589	It &apos;s like a apple apple .
H-1515	-0.8708095550537109	It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s about .
H-1516	-1.358367919921875	It &apos;s not nutrients , or proteins . The scientists are going to do this now .
H-1517	-1.6775983572006226	People could eat and it &apos;s not become blind .
H-1518	-0.7902286052703857	They would be more hungry and you know what ?
H-1519	-1.3765993118286133	It would be good . It wouldn &apos;t be in the honey , but it would be good .
H-1520	-1.0068732500076294	All what I can say is : why do we do against us ?
H-1521	-1.6983577013015747	Do we know , why do we get there ?
H-1522	-0.3933440148830414	Because we don &apos;t want to move genes ?
H-1523	-1.1056957244873047	It &apos;s about the genes , no chemicals .
H-1524	-1.2998757362365723	It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our ability to have more big , better , more sophisticated .
H-1525	-1.290676236152649	It &apos;s not about the end of it , it &apos;s about order to keep people in life and it &apos;s time to understand what it means .
H-1526	-0.4454291760921478	Because , you know what ?
H-1527	-1.3478889465332031	Otherwise , if we continue to act as we do it , we &apos;ll be guilty of something that we don &apos;t want to be : from the high @-@ tech .

H-1529	-1.0479950904846191	It &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s called us and we have to stop this .
H-1530	-1.2231968641281128	So after this conversation funny conversation , you might say , &quot; then , you want to go through this ridiculous machine to travel in the time ? &quot;
H-1531	-0.6428372859954834	Absolutely . I want it .
H-1532	-1.0733981132507324	It &apos;s going on in the present there , but we have a extraordinary opportunity .
H-1533	-1.1365714073181152	We can do this machine on what we want .
H-1534	-0.8401862978935242	We can move it out where we want . We &apos;re going to move it where we want .
H-1535	-1.1519396305084229	We have to have these conversations and we have to think , but we &apos;re going to go up in the machine and you &apos;re going to be happy to do it .
H-1536	-1.1504979133605957	I know that you can . For what &apos;s going to do is something that the world needs now .

H-1538	-1.0497112274169922	Thank you . One day , the L.A. of Los Angeles Times Steve came up in the streets of Los Angeles , when he had a beautiful music .
H-1539	-1.5731815099716187	She came from a man , a American @-@ American @-@ American , a American , without the shelter , who was playing on a violin that had more than two strings .
H-1540	-1.8756574392318726	This story , a lot of you know , because the Steve of Steve inspired a book , which has been adapted to the screen , with Robert Miller , in the role of Steve Lopez , and Jamie Fox in the top of the Spanish Research , the most of the Green School that the career has been lower by a tragic tragic tragic .
H-1541	-1.8715511560440063	Now , in the way , it &apos;s got a total , and 30 years later , he was no shelter in the streets of the bottom , in the center of Los Angeles .
H-1542	-1.0973305702209473	I all encourage you to read the book of Steve , or to look at the film , to understand not only the wonderful link that has created between these two men , but also how music has contributed to shape this link , and finally was the instrument , if you &apos;re going to go out this way , who helped me come out of the street .
H-1543	-1.6185171604156494	I met Mr. than in 2008 , there &apos;s two years ago , the Disney Disney Hall Hall .
H-1544	-2.0149989128112793	He was just just listening to listen to a concert of the first and fourth , &quot; I came out and it &apos;s presented .
H-1545	-2.109217643737793	And he was talking about a very , very quiet way of Yo @-@ Yo @-@ Yo @-@ Yo way and Hillary Clinton , of the reasons that the Dodgers would never have to be the same way , because of the way of the first violin in the last movement of the Japanese School of Beethoven .
H-1546	-1.2031824588775635	And we talked to me . And I got a email to Steve a couple of days later I said that I would give him a violin of violin .
H-1547	-2.203287124633789	Now , I should say that I were going to do that they can &apos;t do it , because when he was treated that was with the world , and that , and that , all his life , he suffered from this trauma .
H-1548	-2.650414228439331	But , now , it &apos;s actually a result that it is to be able to get the other ones .
H-1549	-2.2776994705200195	In the worst of their things , it goes up , and then then put up for days , then in the street streets , exposed to his neighbors , the rise of his mind in him .
H-1550	-1.366889238357544	And it was in a such state , when we started our first lesson in the Disney Disney Hall Hall that there was a kind of dark reflection in his eyes , he had lost it lost .
H-1551	-1.3730790615081787	And he was talking about invisible waves and smoke , and how somebody &apos;s in his sleep .
H-1552	-1.7918586730957031	And I was afraid , not for me , but I was afraid of losing it , that he turned up in the one of his crises , and that I would get her relationship with the violin if I started talking about a lot of other and and the other interesting forms of the global regulation of violin .
H-1553	-0.6095880270004272	So , I just started playing .
H-1554	-2.2095682621002197	I played the first movement of the afternoon to violin .
H-1555	-1.3740456104278564	And as I was walking , I saw a profound change in the eyes .
H-1556	-1.3504706621170044	It was like if he was under the center of an invisible @-@ invisible product , a chemical reaction , which the music I was playing was the catalyst .
H-1557	-2.6947126388549805	And it &apos;s just a little bit of Georgetown turned out in understanding , curiosity , and by thanks .
H-1558	-1.7379827499389648	And as by miracle , he went up his own violin , and he started playing the ear , some of them to violin that he asked me to do , you know , you know ,
H-1559	-2.117794990539551	And we began to talk about music , Bach to Beethoven , &quot; Hey , all , all the B , in the way , until you &apos;re doing it .
H-1560	-0.8222393989562988	And I realized that not only had a strong knowledge of music , but he had a link with this music , to a personal level .
H-1561	-0.8304992318153381	He talked about the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues from the National Angeles of Los Angeles .
H-1562	-2.1677143573760986	In playing the music , and talking of music , this man was transformed , of the man , the man , so , who would be in the streets of the center of Los Angeles in Los Angeles , in this lovely , and it &apos;s a lot of a lot of Pittsburgh .
H-1563	-0.7723751664161682	The music is medicine . The music will change .
H-1564	-1.17839515209198	And for myself , music is mental health .
H-1565	-1.2875645160675049	Because the music allows him to take his thoughts and the biases , and bring them through his imagination and creativity , in reality .
H-1566	-1.5239473581314087	And it &apos;s a mind of its inner state .
H-1567	-0.8974186182022095	And I understood that it was the same thing of art .
H-1568	-0.9027959704399109	This is the reason we &apos;ve created the music , to take something that exists in each of us , at the most fundamental level of our being , of our emotions , and because to our art , by our creativity , we are able to form these emotions in reality .
H-1569	-1.5267561674118042	And the reality of this expression has each of us , and we go , we know , and we &apos;re growing .
H-1570	-1.7377947568893433	And in the way , the music brought it in his friends .
H-1571	-1.522220492362976	The American power of the music brought it in the family of the musicians who understood it , have recognized his talents and then it .
H-1572	-1.6637040376663208	And I &apos;m still going to be able to do the music with myself , that we &apos;re going to the Disney Disney Hall , or on the bottom , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
H-1573	-0.1301618367433548	Thank you .
H-1574	-0.6739400625228882	I thank you . Thank you .
H-1575	-2.798292875289917	Audience : Yeah .
H-1576	-1.695657730102539	I want to play something that I &apos;ve got out of the way .
H-1577	-1.5352857112884521	So , if you &apos;re like me . There &apos;s several years ago , here in Ted , Peter means presented a design of design called the marshmallow .
H-1578	-0.5459136366844177	And the idea is pretty simple .
H-1579	-1.4061461687088013	The teams of four people have to build the most high structure to put up with 20 , a meter meter , a meter meter , and a marshmallow .
H-1580	-1.3410948514938354	The marshmallow has to be placed at the top .
H-1581	-1.5030101537704468	And what it really seems very simple , it &apos;s actually pretty difficult , because it &apos;s going to get people to collaborate quickly .
H-1582	-0.9414446949958801	I found that it was a interesting idea , then I put it in a design shop .
H-1583	-0.6284469366073608	And it was a great success .
H-1584	-1.3451220989227295	Since , I &apos;ve got about 70 design of design in the whole world , with students , designers and architects , and even the non @-@ companies , and there &apos;s something in this exercise that reveals to be able to do with the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some with you .
H-1585	-0.9830795526504517	Now , normally most people are starting to take their brands by the task .
H-1586	-1.1392700672149658	They &apos;re talking about , they &apos;re looking at what it &apos;s going to look like , they &apos;re going to be able to be that , and then they spend a bit of time to plan , to organize .
H-1587	-1.5900261402130127	They &apos;re doing sketches , and they get them . They spend the most part of their time to put them in more and bigger , and then , at the end , just when the Molas gets down , someone takes the marshmallow , and the ask it in the top , and they &apos;re going to go , and ... Your .
H-1588	-1.5121655464172363	They have their work .
H-1589	-1.5365694761276245	But in fact , what happens , most of the time is that the &quot; your your touch , &quot; is that the &quot; your eye , &quot; is in &quot; oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow is that all the structure is going to be like .
H-1590	-1.2505481243133545	There &apos;s a number of participants that have much more &quot; oh , &quot; and the other , and , among the worst , the young kids of trade schools .
H-1591	-1.2705190181732178	They lie , they cheat , they &apos;re broken , and the structures that they produce are really clear .
H-1592	-1.8690190315246582	And of course , there are teams that produce much more structures . &quot; and , among the best , the young @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@
H-1593	-0.5548118352890015	And that &apos;s really amazing .
H-1594	-0.7402426600456238	As the says Peter , not only they produce the most high @-@ high structures , but it &apos;s also the most interesting structures .
H-1595	-1.1021007299423218	So , the question that we ask , is , how do it do ? Why ? What are they special ?
H-1596	-1.547360897064209	Peter likes to say this : &quot; No children has spent a single minute to try to become a lot of the same way . &quot;
H-1597	-1.5479471683502197	They don &apos;t spend their time to the power for the power .
H-1598	-0.5065848231315613	But there &apos;s also another reason .
H-1599	-1.2405813932418823	That &apos;s the students of trade schools are trained to find the single plan that will work .
H-1600	-0.9194366931915283	And then put it to work .
H-1601	-0.8683119416236877	And then , what happens , when they ask the marshmallow at the top , they &apos;re not their rest of time , and then ?
H-1602	-0.46623679995536804	It &apos;s the crisis .
H-1603	-1.0770740509033203	It reminds you something ? Good .
H-1604	-1.4926872253417969	What the teams teams are doing differently is that they start by the marshmallow , and build prototypes , prototypes prototypes , always always do the marshmallow at the top , and have many of many opportunities to repair prototypes in difficulty .
H-1605	-1.3664640188217163	The designers will recognize this kind of cooperation like the basic basis of the process .
H-1606	-1.541617512702942	With every version , the kids have a lot of a tech information on what works or not .
H-1607	-0.4771108329296112	So the ability to work with prototypes is essential , but see what are the results of different teams .
H-1608	-1.074018955230713	The average for most of the people is 50 inches , for the students students , about half of half , lawyers , a little bit better , but not a lot , and for a lot , better than the majority of adults .
H-1609	-0.724833607673645	Who are really the best ?
H-1610	-0.6775044202804565	The architects and engineers , fortunately !
H-1611	-0.849391520023346	A meter , it &apos;s the most high structure that I &apos;ve seen .
H-1612	-1.1018589735031128	And why ? Because they understand that the triangles and the car @-@ car patterns are the key to build stable structures .
H-1613	-1.1447861194610596	The technical managers , so , do a little bit better than the average .
H-1614	-0.6314826011657715	But this is where it &apos;s interesting .
H-1615	-1.5853216648101807	If you add a giant framework in the team , the results are looking at a significant way .
H-1616	-0.6099056601524353	It &apos;s incredible . You know , you look around you , and you say , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s the team that will win . &quot;
H-1617	-1.2944389581680298	We can say it in the advance . And why ?
H-1618	-1.8062641620635986	Because they have these very special skills .
H-1619	-1.4030277729034424	They make the process , they understand it .
H-1620	-1.8766967058181763	And all of the team that runs and follows with a big attention to the global work of how much its performance .
H-1621	-1.5234776735305786	The skills and skills skills , their combination led to success .
H-1622	-1.3666812181472778	If you &apos;ve got 10 teams , six , six , maybe a structure that &apos;s standing standing .
H-1623	-0.49037331342697144	And I tried something interesting .
H-1624	-1.5514848232269287	I thought , &quot; This time , get the way . &quot;
H-1625	-1.40122652053833	So I offered a cost of a 10 @-@ dollar value in software to the American team .
H-1626	-0.9370805025100708	And what do you think it happened to these students in design ?
H-1627	-0.6717048287391663	What was the result ?
H-1628	-0.4000051021575928	This is what happened .
H-1629	-2.199946641921997	Not a only team had to put up up up up .
H-1630	-1.0533331632614136	If one one had built , say , a three @-@ inch structure , they would put the price at the house !
H-1631	-1.8463234901428223	So , isn &apos;t it interesting , that the high @-@ high @-@ high @-@ high @-@ strong impact ?
H-1632	-0.9234414100646973	We have the exercise with the same students .
H-1633	-0.992258608341217	What do you think it &apos;s what happened ?
H-1634	-1.849945306777954	Now , they had the importance of the breath .
H-1635	-1.2603602409362793	And the same team came from the group of worst of the best .
H-1636	-0.836945116519928	They realized the most high structure in the most short time .
H-1637	-0.9657629728317261	There &apos;s there &apos;s great lessons for us , about the nature of motivations and success .
H-1638	-1.7150222063064575	So , you might ask you , &quot; Why does you go on the time to organize a free . &quot;
H-1639	-0.8183671236038208	The reason is that I help to create digital tools and process that help teams to make automobiles , video games , and special effects .
H-1640	-1.9794892072677612	And what it &apos;s the way of the way , it &apos;s that it helps them to identify the hidden trees .
H-1641	-0.5896562337875366	Because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , right ?
H-1642	-0.901444137096405	The competition gives a shared experience , a common language , a common attitude to build the &quot; good &quot; prototype .
H-1643	-0.7418904304504395	And that &apos;s that , the value of this experience , of this exercise so simple .
H-1644	-1.5334218740463257	And those people are going to go on .
H-1645	-1.468463659286499	It &apos;s a blog that you can take on the way to drive the free . &quot;
H-1646	-0.9959461688995361	There &apos;s instructions not not .
H-1647	-1.679154634475708	There are some crazy examples of the whole world , how the people are walking and get the system .
H-1648	-1.050053596496582	There &apos;s also the world of the world .
H-1649	-0.6670973300933838	And the fundamental lesson , I think , is that design is actually a contact sport .
H-1650	-1.3078029155731201	It requires that we all make our sense of the task , and we know the best of our thinking , of our sense and our application to the challenge that we &apos;ve in front of us .
H-1651	-0.8584583401679993	And , sometimes , a little prototype of this experience will be the only thing that will allow us to do a &quot; oh @-@ oh . &quot;
H-1652	-0.7077927589416504	And it can do a big difference .
H-1653	-0.4506116807460785	Thank you very much .
